# Cybersecurity Foundations

Set a rock-solid foundation for your network, users, and data by learning about the basics of cybersecurity. Join security expert Malcolm Shore as he describes how to assess and mitigate risks using various cybersecurity frameworks and control standards, such as NIST and COBIT.

Malcolm details pertinent cyber threats and how they operate, including how cyber criminals hide their attacks, how advanced persistent threats work, and even how to determine what's real and what's merely cyber fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD). He also covers the way in which cyber risk is managed and the lifecycle of cybersecurityâ€”from managing defense through to preparing for and responding to an incident. And since cybersecurity has taken on an increasingly visible global dimension, Malcolm concludes the course with a discussion of international cyber norms and protocols.

## Differentiate between the phases of the Cyber Kill Chain

The **Cyber Kill Chain** is a framework developed by Lockheed Martin to describe the stages of a cyber attack from reconnaissance to exfiltration. Understanding these phases helps organizations detect and mitigate attacks before they cause damage.

1. **Reconnaissance** - The attacker gathers intelligence about the target system, identifying vulnerabilities and potential entry points.
2. **Weaponization** - The attacker creates a malicious payload, often coupling malware with an exploit.
3. **Delivery** - The attacker transmits the weaponized payload to the victim via phishing emails, malicious links, or compromised websites.
4. **Exploitation** - The payload is executed, exploiting vulnerabilities to gain a foothold in the system.
5. **Installation** - Malware is installed to establish persistence, often creating backdoors for future access.
6. **Command and Control (C2)** - The attacker remotely controls the compromised system, executing commands and escalating privileges.
7. **Actions on Objectives** - The attacker achieves their goal, which could be data exfiltration, system disruption, or lateral movement within the network.

## Describe the several types of cyber attacks

Cyber attacks vary in complexity and objectives. Here are the most common types:

- **Malware**: Malicious software such as viruses, worms, Trojans, and ransomware designed to damage or control systems.
- **Phishing**: Social engineering attacks that trick users into revealing sensitive information via fraudulent emails or messages.
- **Denial-of-Service (DoS) & Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) Attacks**: Overloading a system with traffic to make it unavailable.
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks**: Intercepting and altering communication between two parties without their knowledge.
- **SQL Injection**: Injecting malicious SQL statements into input fields to manipulate databases.
- **Zero-Day Exploits**: Exploiting unknown vulnerabilities before patches are available.
- **Password Attacks**: Brute force, dictionary, and credential stuffing attacks to gain unauthorized access.
- **Insider Threats**: Malicious or negligent actions by employees or contractors that compromise security.

## Explain what the NIST Cybersecurity Framework is

The **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)**, developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, provides a structured approach to managing cybersecurity risks. It consists of five core functions:

1. **Identify** - Understand organizational risks, assets, and vulnerabilities.
2. **Protect** - Implement safeguards to ensure system integrity and data security.
3. **Detect** - Monitor networks and systems to identify cybersecurity events.
4. **Respond** - Develop an action plan to mitigate and contain security incidents.
5. **Recover** - Restore affected capabilities and services after a cybersecurity event.

## Explain what the COBIT Cybersecurity Framework is

**COBIT (Control Objectives for Information and Related Technologies)** is a framework developed by ISACA for IT governance and management. COBIT's cybersecurity approach focuses on aligning IT security with business objectives.

Key components include:

- **Governance and Risk Management**: Establishing cybersecurity policies and strategies.
- **Control Objectives**: Defining security measures across processes.
- **Maturity Models**: Assessing and improving cybersecurity capabilities.
- **Performance Metrics**: Measuring the effectiveness of cybersecurity controls.

## Interpret basic practices of cyber risk

Cyber risk management involves identifying, assessing, and mitigating security risks to an organization. Fundamental practices include:

- **Risk Assessment**: Identifying threats, vulnerabilities, and potential impacts.
- **Threat Modeling**: Analyzing how threats could exploit system weaknesses.
- **Risk Mitigation Strategies**: Implementing security controls such as firewalls, encryption, and access management.
- **Incident Response Planning**: Preparing for security breaches to minimize damage.
- **Compliance and Regulations**: Adhering to frameworks like GDPR, HIPAA, and ISO 27001.

## Determine which elements are used in developing a secure architecture

A **secure architecture** ensures that security is embedded in the design of IT systems. Essential elements include:

- **Defense-in-Depth**: Layered security controls to mitigate multiple attack vectors.
- **Least Privilege**: Restricting user access based on necessity.
- **Zero Trust Model**: Verifying every access request as though it originated from an untrusted source.
- **Encryption**: Protecting data at rest and in transit.
- **Security Monitoring**: Using SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) tools to detect threats.
- **Patch Management**: Regularly updating software to fix vulnerabilities.

## Articulate the best approach to respond to an incident

Incident response is crucial in mitigating damage from cyber threats. A structured approach follows these steps:

1. **Preparation** - Develop an incident response plan, conduct training, and set up monitoring tools.
2. **Identification** - Detect security events, analyze logs, and confirm incidents.
3. **Containment** - Isolate affected systems to prevent further spread.
4. **Eradication** - Remove threats, patch vulnerabilities, and restore system integrity.
5. **Recovery** - Restore normal operations while monitoring for residual threats.
6. **Lessons Learned** - Analyze the incident, document findings, and improve security policies.

## Describe the seven principles for global cybersecurity users

The **seven principles for global cybersecurity users** provide guidelines for responsible cybersecurity behavior:

1. **Awareness and Training** - Educate users on security risks and best practices.
2. **Personal Accountability** - Ensure individuals take responsibility for their online security.
3. **Strong Authentication** - Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) to secure access.
4. **Privacy Protection** - Follow data protection laws and respect user privacy.
5. **Secure Software Development** - Build security into applications from the ground up.
6. **Resilience and Recovery** - Plan for continuity and rapid recovery from incidents.
7. **Collaboration and Sharing** - Share threat intelligence to strengthen global cybersecurity efforts.
