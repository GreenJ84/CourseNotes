# **Algorithm for File Updates in Python**

## **Project description**

In this project, you are a security professional working at a healthcare company. Your role requires regularly updating a file that identifies employees with access to restricted content based on their IP addresses. The file contains an allow list and a remove list. The task is to create an algorithm that checks if any IP addresses from the remove list are in the allow list and removes them if necessary. This task helps ensure that access to sensitive data is restricted only to authorized personnel.

## **Open the file that contains the allow list**

To open the file containing the allow list, assign the string `"allow_list.txt"` to the `import_file` variable. Use a `with` statement to open the file and store it in the `file` variable for further processing.

```python
import_file = "allow_list.txt"
with open(import_file, 'r') as file:
    # processing the file
    pass
```

## **Read the file contents**

The contents of the allow list file are read into memory using the `.read()` method. This converts the entire file's contents into a string, which is stored in the `ip_addresses` variable.

```python
ip_addresses = file.read()
```

## **Convert the string into a list**

To work with individual IP addresses, the string of IPs is split into a list using the `.split()` method. This breaks the string into a list of IP addresses, with each address as a separate element.

```python
ip_addresses = ip_addresses.split("\n")
```

## **Iterate through the remove list**

A `for` loop iterates through the `remove_list`, checking each element (IP address) to see if it exists in the `ip_addresses` list.

```python
for element in remove_list:
    # check if element is in the ip_addresses list
    pass
```

## **Remove IP addresses that are on the remove list**

If the current `element` from the remove list is found in the `ip_addresses` list, the `.remove()` method is used to delete it from the list. This method is applied only if the element exists in the list, ensuring that no errors occur.

```python
if element in ip_addresses:
    ip_addresses.remove(element)
```

## **Update the file with the revised list of IP addresses**

After removing the necessary IP addresses, the list is converted back to a string using the `.join()` method. The elements of the list are joined by a newline character (`\n`), and the updated list is written back to the file using the `.write()` method.

```python
ip_addresses = "\n".join(ip_addresses)
with open(import_file, 'w') as file:
    file.write(ip_addresses)
```

## **Summary**

This algorithm successfully updates an allow list by removing specific IP addresses based on the contents of a remove list. The algorithm demonstrates file handling, list manipulation, and iteration in Python. It opens a file, reads its contents, splits the data into a list, removes specified entries, and writes the updated list back to the file. These actions help ensure that only the appropriate personnel have access to sensitive resources in a healthcare environment.
