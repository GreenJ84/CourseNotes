# **Protect Against Threats, Risks, and Vulnerabilities**

In this module, you'll learn how organizations protect themselves from threats, risks, and vulnerabilities. Topics covered include security frameworks, controls, and ethics. You'll also explore the **CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability)** and the **National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) frameworks**, which help organizations develop security policies and procedures.

## **Security as a Garden: An Analogy**

Security is an evolving process, much like maintaining a garden.

- **Planning & Preparation:** Identify potential risks (e.g., weeds, pests, weather).
- **Implementing Protections:** Install fences, use surveillance, and create policies to safeguard assets.
- **Continuous Improvement:** Adjust policies and controls based on new threats.

Organizations follow a similar approach to security—monitoring, adapting, and strengthening their defenses over time.

## **Learning Objectives**

- **Security Frameworks and Controls:** Understanding their role in mitigating risks.
- **CIA Triad & NIST CSF:** Understanding how these models guide security strategies.
- **Security Ethics:** Exploring ethical considerations in cybersecurity.

## **CIA Triad**

- **Confidentiality**: Ensures only authorized users can access data.
- **Integrity**: Ensures data is accurate and tamper-proof (e.g., encryption).
- **Availability**: Ensures authorized users can access data when needed.

## **Importance of Frameworks and Controls**

- **Security frameworks and controls** are vital for managing security across organizations and ensuring everyone contributes to maintaining low-risk levels.
- As a security analyst, understanding how these frameworks and controls work enables you to support the organization's security goals and protect its assets and users effectively.

### Security Frameworks

- Guidelines for mitigating risks and threats, with four core components:
  - Identifying and documenting security goals
  - Setting guidelines to achieve security goals
  - Implementing strong security processes
  - Monitoring and communicating results
- They provide a structured approach to implementing a security lifecycle—an evolving set of policies and standards that help manage risks, ensure regulatory compliance, and meet organizational goals.

#### Purpose of Security Frameworks

- Frameworks are used to manage different types of organizational and regulatory compliance risks, such as protecting personally identifiable information (PII), securing financial information, and identifying security weaknesses.

##### Compliance

- Adhering to internal standards and external regulations.
- They help align security efforts with business goals and regulatory requirements.

##### Notable Regulations

Security frameworks align with regulatory requirements to ensure compliance and reduce risks. Key compliance standards include:

- **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)** – E.U. law protecting personal data and privacy.
- **Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)** – Ensures secure handling of credit card transactions.
- **Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)** – Protects patient health information in the U.S.
- **Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP)** – Standardizes cloud security for U.S. government agencies.

#### Four Core Components of Security Frameworks

1. **Identifying and Documenting Security Goals**: For example, aligning with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for better data protection.
2. **Setting Guidelines to Achieve Security Goals**: Creating policies to ensure compliance with regulations, such as handling data requests from users.
3. **Implementing Strong Security Processes**: Designing procedures, like ensuring compliance with user data requests under GDPR.
4. **Monitoring and Communicating Results**: Continuously monitoring the network and reporting potential security issues to relevant stakeholders.

#### Notable Frameworks

- **NIST Frameworks**
      - **NIST CSF**: Manages cybersecurity risk with a baseline for risk management.
      - **NIST RMF**: Focuses on risk management processes.
- **FERC-NERC**: Applies to U.S. power grid-related organizations.
- **FedRAMP**: Standardizes security for cloud services in U.S. government agencies.
- **CIS**: Provides controls to safeguard systems and networks.
- **GDPR**: Protects data privacy of EU residents.
- **PCI DSS**: Ensures secure handling of credit card information.
- **HIPAA**: Protects U.S. patient health information.
- **ISO**: Establishes international standards for technology, manufacturing, and management.
- **SOC Reports**: Focuses on user access and data safety in organizations.
- **Executive Order 14028**: Enhances U.S. cybersecurity related to federal agencies and critical infrastructure.


### Security Controls

- Security controls are safeguards to reduce specific security risks. For example, implementing privacy training for employees to reduce data breaches.
- Security analysts may use tools to assign and track training completion and ensure compliance with security policies.

## **Ethics in Security**

- Ethics in security guide daily decisions, ensuring cybersecurity professionals make appropriate, legal, and ethical responses to threats and breaches.

### Key Ethical Principles

#### 1. **Confidentiality**

- Security professionals must safeguard proprietary or private information, such as Personally Identifiable Information (PII).
- Example: Providing unauthorized access to a coworker can result in legal consequences, reprimands, and loss of reputation.

#### 2. **Privacy Protection**

- Safeguarding personal information from unauthorized use.
- Example: Accessing and sharing an employee's personal information outside of secure channels violates privacy protection policies.

#### 3. **Law**

- Laws govern actions and are enforced by a governing entity.
- Example: A hospital staff member leaving confidential data unattended violates compliance regulations and is both unethical and illegal.

### Ethical Concerns with Counterattacks

#### United States Standpoint**

- **Counterattacks are illegal** under laws such as the **Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) of 1986** and the **Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act (CISA) of 2015**.
- Unauthorized retaliation is considered **vigilantism** and can escalate cyber conflicts.
- Only federal employees or military personnel are permitted to conduct counter-cyber operations.

#### International Standpoint

The **International Court of Justice (ICJ)** outlines strict guidelines for counterattacks:

- The response must **only** target the original attacker.
- It must serve as a **direct warning** rather than escalate the situation.
- It should be **reversible** and proportionate.
- Due to these complexities, most organizations **avoid counterattacks** to minimize risk.

#### Organizations' Standpoint

- Counterattacks are risky and generally discouraged because they often escalate issues.

### Ethical Responsibilities of Security Professionals

To uphold cybersecurity ethics, professionals must:

- **Remain unbiased** and act with integrity.
- **Follow established security protocols** rather than personal judgment.
- **Ensure transparency** in security practices.
- **Stay informed** about evolving threats, laws, and best practices.

## **Key Takeaways**

- Security frameworks and controls provide structured methods to **identify, mitigate, and respond** to threats. By following these frameworks, security analysts help protect organizations and individuals from potential security risks.
- Security is an evolving industry that requires continuous monitoring and improvement, similar to maintaining a healthy garden.
- Over time, more robust security measures (like installing surveillance cameras, building fences, and implementing better policies) are necessary to safeguard against emerging risks.
- Security frameworks and controls are essential to organizing and improving security efforts.
- We'll discuss the importance of these frameworks and specific examples such as the **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA) Triad**.
- Ethics plays a central role in cybersecurity, guiding decisions on confidentiality, privacy, and legal compliance.
- Counterattacks are largely **illegal** and discouraged due to potential escalation and legal risks.
- Security professionals must act with **honesty, responsibility, and transparency** to protect organizations and individuals.
