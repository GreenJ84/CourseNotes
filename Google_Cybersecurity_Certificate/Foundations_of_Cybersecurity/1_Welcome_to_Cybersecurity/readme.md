## Google Cybersecurity Certificate: Foundations of Cybersecurity

### Responsibilities of an Entry-Level Cybersecurity Analyst

- **Monitor and Protect Systems:**
  - Observe internal networks and respond to threats.
  - Conduct penetration testing and ethical hacking.
  
- **Prevent Threats:**
  - Work with IT teams to install security software.
  - Support security integration in software and hardware development.

- **Conduct Security Audits:**
  - Review security policies and documentation.
  - Ensure sensitive information remains protected.

- **Ensure Business Continuity:**
  - Maintain security protocols to minimize operational disruptions.
  - Uphold compliance with industry regulations.

- **Safeguard Reputation and Trust:**
  - Prevent data breaches that could harm an organization's reputation.
  - Protect customer and stakeholder information from unauthorized access.

### Define the Field of Security

- Cybersecurity ensures **confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA)** of data.
- Protects networks, devices, and people from unauthorized access or exploitation.
- Addresses both **external threats** (e.g., hackers, malware) and **internal threats** (e.g., insider misuse, accidental breaches).
- Security teams enforce compliance, maintain business continuity, and reduce risks.

### Recognize Core Skills and Knowledge Needed to Become a Security Analyst

- **Technical Proficiency:** Familiarity with networking, systems, and programming languages.
- **Threat Analysis:** Ability to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities.
- **Security Frameworks:** Understanding compliance standards such as NIST, ISO/IEC 27001, and CIS Controls.
- **Problem-Solving:** Quickly addressing and resolving security incidents.
- **Collaboration and Communication:** Working with teams to implement security best practices.

### Identify How Security Attacks Impact Business Operations

- **Financial Risks:** Data breaches can result in legal fines, lawsuits, and recovery costs.
- **Operational Downtime:** Cyberattacks can disrupt services and decrease productivity.
- **Reputation Damage:** Loss of customer trust can reduce revenue and impact brand image.
- **Regulatory Consequences:** Non-compliance with security regulations may lead to penalties.

### Identify Eight Security Domains (CISSP)

1. **Security & Risk Management** – Governance, risk assessment, and compliance.
2. **Asset Security** – Data classification, retention policies, and ownership.
3. **Security Architecture & Engineering** – Secure system design and implementation.
4. **Communication & Network Security** – Securing data transmission and infrastructure.
5. **Identity & Access Management (IAM)** – User authentication and authorization controls.
6. **Security Assessment & Testing** – Conducting vulnerability scans and audits.
7. **Security Operations** – Incident response, monitoring, and recovery.
8. **Software Development Security** – Secure coding practices and application protection.

### Define Security Frameworks and Controls

- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF):** Guides organizations in identifying and managing risks.
- **ISO/IEC 27001:** Establishes international standards for information security management.
- **COBIT:** Ensures IT governance and aligns security with business objectives.
- **CIS Controls:** A prioritized set of security best practices to prevent cyber

### Key Cybersecurity Terms and Concepts

There are many terms and concepts that are important for security professionals to know. Being familiar with them can help you better identify the threats that can harm organizations and people alike. A security analyst or cybersecurity analyst focuses on monitoring networks for breaches. They also help develop strategies to secure an organization and research information technology (IT) security trends to remain alert and informed about potential threats. Additionally, an analyst works to prevent incidents. In order for analysts to effectively do these types of tasks, they need to develop knowledge of the following key concepts.

- **Cybersecurity (or security)**: The practice of ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information by protecting networks, devices, people, and data from unauthorized access or criminal exploitation.

- **Personally identifiable information (PII)**: Any information used to infer an individual’s identity.

- **Sensitive personally identifiable information (SPII)**: A specific type of PII that falls under stricter handling guidelines.

- **Technical skills**: Skills that require knowledge of specific tools, procedures, and policies.

- **Threat**: Any circumstance or event that can negatively impact assets.

- **Transferable skills**: Skills from other areas that can apply to different careers.

- **Compliance** is the process of adhering to internal standards and external regulations and enables organizations to avoid fines and security breaches.

- **Security frameworks** are guidelines used for building plans to help mitigate risks and threats to data and privacy.

- **Security controls** are safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks. They are used with security frameworks to establish a strong security posture.

- **Security posture** is an organization’s ability to manage its defense of critical assets and data and react to change. A strong security posture leads to lower risk for the organization.

- **A threat actor**, or malicious attacker, is any person or group who presents a security risk. This risk can relate to computers, applications, networks, and data.

- **An internal threat** can be a current or former employee, an external vendor, or a trusted partner who poses a security risk. At times, an internal threat is accidental. For example, an employee who accidentally clicks on a malicious email link would be considered an accidental threat. Other times, the internal threat actor intentionally engages in risky activities, such as unauthorized data access.

- **Network security** is the practice of keeping an organization's network infrastructure secure from unauthorized access. This includes data, services, systems, and devices that are stored in an organization’s network.

- **Cloud security** is the process of ensuring that assets stored in the cloud are properly configured, or set up correctly, and access to those assets is limited to authorized users. The cloud is a network made up of a collection of servers or computers that store resources and data in remote physical locations known as data centers that can be accessed via the internet. Cloud security is a growing subfield of cybersecurity that specifically focuses on the protection of data, applications, and infrastructure in the cloud.

- **Programming** is a process that can be used to create a specific set of instructions for a computer to execute tasks. These tasks can include:
  - Automation of repetitive tasks (e.g., searching a list of malicious domains)
  - Reviewing web traffic
  - Alerting suspicious activity

### Key Takeaways

As you’ve learned, cybersecurity (also known as security) is the practice of ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information by protecting networks, devices, people, and data from unauthorized access or criminal exploitation.
