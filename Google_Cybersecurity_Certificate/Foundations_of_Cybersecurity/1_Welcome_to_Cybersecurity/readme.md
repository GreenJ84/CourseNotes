## **Introduction to Cybersecurity**

Cybersecurity is the practice of ensuring the **confidentiality, integrity, and availability** of information by protecting networks, devices, people, and data from unauthorized access or criminal exploitation. Security teams play a crucial role in defending organizations against both external and internal threats.

### Responsibilities of an Entry-Level Cybersecurity Analyst

- **Monitor and Protect Systems:**
  - Observe internal networks and respond to threats.
  - Conduct penetration testing and ethical hacking.
  
- **Prevent Threats:**
  - Work with IT teams to install security software.
  - Support security integration in software and hardware development.

- **Conduct Security Audits:**
  - Review security policies and documentation.
  - Ensure sensitive information remains protected.

- **Ensure Business Continuity:**
  - Maintain security protocols to minimize operational disruptions.
  - Uphold compliance with industry regulations.

- **Safeguard Reputation and Trust:**
  - Prevent data breaches that could harm an organization's reputation.
  - Protect customer and stakeholder information from unauthorized access.

#### Security Threats and Protection

Security analysts work to safeguard an organization’s information and respond to threats when they occur. Threats can be categorized as:

- **External threats** – Attackers outside the organization attempting to gain unauthorized access.
- **Internal threats** – Risks originating from employees, vendors, or partners, whether accidental or intentional.

To mitigate these risks, security teams implement protection strategies such as:

- Using complex passwords to enhance confidentiality
- Monitoring network activity for suspicious behavior
- Establishing security frameworks and controls to uphold compliance

### Identify How Security Attacks Impact Business Operations

- **Financial Risks:** Data breaches can result in legal fines, lawsuits, and recovery costs.
- **Operational Downtime:** Cyberattacks can disrupt services and decrease productivity.
- **Reputation Damage:** Loss of customer trust can reduce revenue and impact brand image.
- **Regulatory Consequences:** Non-compliance with security regulations may lead to penalties.


### Career Paths in Cybersecurity

After completing this certificate program, learners can explore various cybersecurity roles, including:

- Security Analyst or Specialist
- Cybersecurity Analyst or Specialist
- Security Operations Center (SOC) Analyst
- Information Security Analyst

## **Core Skills for Cybersecurity Professionals**

Successful cybersecurity professionals need both **transferable** and **technical** skills.
