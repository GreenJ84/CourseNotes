# Module Overview: Protect against Threats, Risks, and Vulnerabilities

In this module, we'll explore how organizations protect themselves from various threats, risks, and vulnerabilities. We will cover key principles such as frameworks, controls, and ethics, using an analogy to explain these concepts and how they relate to the role of a security analyst.

## **CIA Triad**

- **Confidentiality**: Ensures only authorized users can access data.
- **Integrity**: Ensures data is accurate and tamper-proof (e.g., encryption).
- **Availability**: Ensures authorized users can access data when needed.

## Importance of Frameworks and Controls

- **Security frameworks and controls** are vital for managing security across organizations and ensuring everyone contributes to maintaining low-risk levels.
- As a security analyst, understanding how these frameworks and controls work enables you to support the organization's security goals and protect its assets and users effectively.

### Security Frameworks

- Guidelines for mitigating risks and threats, with four core components:
  - Identifying and documenting security goals
  - Setting guidelines to achieve security goals
  - Implementing strong security processes
  - Monitoring and communicating results
- They provide a structured approach to implementing a security lifecycleâ€”an evolving set of policies and standards that help manage risks, ensure regulatory compliance, and meet organizational goals.

#### Purpose of Security Frameworks

- Frameworks are used to manage different types of organizational and regulatory compliance risks, such as protecting personally identifiable information (PII), securing financial information, and identifying security weaknesses.
  - **Compliance**:
    - Adhering to internal standards and external regulations.
- They help align security efforts with business goals and regulatory requirements.

#### Four Core Components of Security Frameworks

1. **Identifying and Documenting Security Goals**: For example, aligning with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for better data protection.
2. **Setting Guidelines to Achieve Security Goals**: Creating policies to ensure compliance with regulations, such as handling data requests from users.
3. **Implementing Strong Security Processes**: Designing procedures, like ensuring compliance with user data requests under GDPR.
4. **Monitoring and Communicating Results**: Continuously monitoring the network and reporting potential security issues to relevant stakeholders.

##### **NIST Frameworks**

- **NIST CSF**: Manages cybersecurity risk with a baseline for risk management.
- **NIST RMF**: Focuses on risk management processes.

##### **Other Notable Frameworks and Regulations**

- **FERC-NERC**: Applies to U.S. power grid-related organizations.
- **FedRAMP**: Standardizes security for cloud services in U.S. government agencies.
- **CIS**: Provides controls to safeguard systems and networks.
- **GDPR**: Protects data privacy of EU residents.
- **PCI DSS**: Ensures secure handling of credit card information.
- **HIPAA**: Protects U.S. patient health information.
- **ISO**: Establishes international standards for technology, manufacturing, and management.
- **SOC Reports**: Focuses on user access and data safety in organizations.
- **Executive Order 14028**: Enhances U.S. cybersecurity related to federal agencies and critical infrastructure.


### Security Controls

- Security controls are safeguards to reduce specific security risks. For example, implementing privacy training for employees to reduce data breaches.
- Security analysts may use tools to assign and track training completion and ensure compliance with security policies.




## Ethics in Security

- Ethics in security guide daily decisions, ensuring cybersecurity professionals make appropriate, legal, and ethical responses to threats and breaches.

### Key Ethical Principles

#### 1. **Confidentiality**

- Security professionals must safeguard proprietary or private information, such as Personally Identifiable Information (PII).
- Example: Providing unauthorized access to a coworker can result in legal consequences, reprimands, and loss of reputation.

#### 2. **Privacy Protection**

- Safeguarding personal information from unauthorized use.
- Example: Accessing and sharing an employee's personal information outside of secure channels violates privacy protection policies.

#### 3. **Law**

- Laws govern actions and are enforced by a governing entity.
- Example: A hospital staff member leaving confidential data unattended violates compliance regulations and is both unethical and illegal.

### Ethical Concerns and Laws

#### Counterattacks

- **U.S. Law:** Counterattacks are illegal due to laws like the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (1986) and Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act (2015). The U.S. only allows federal and military personnel to counterattack.
- **International Law:** The International Court of Justice (ICJ) allows counterattacks under strict conditions, such as not escalating the situation or affecting non-attacking parties.
- **Organizations' Stance:** Counterattacks are risky and generally discouraged because they often escalate issues.

## Key Concepts

1. **Evolving Security Practices**
   - Security is an evolving industry that requires continuous monitoring and improvement, similar to maintaining a healthy garden.
   - Over time, more robust security measures (like installing surveillance cameras, building fences, and implementing better policies) are necessary to safeguard against emerging risks.

2. **Security Frameworks and Controls**
   - Security frameworks and controls are essential to organizing and improving security efforts.
   - We'll discuss the importance of these frameworks and specific examples such as the **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA) Triad**.

3. **Ethics in Security**
   - Ethical considerations in security are crucial. We'll discuss common ethical concerns within the security field.
   - The module will highlight how using tools like security keys (a type of control) enhances confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
