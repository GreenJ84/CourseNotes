## **Module Overview**

In this module, you will learn about:

- **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tools**, which help monitor and analyze security incidents.
- **Playbooks**, which provide step-by-step incident response procedures.
- **Network Protocol Analyzers**, which examine network traffic for potential threats.
- **Linux**, an essential operating system for cybersecurity professionals.
- **Programming languages** like **SQL** and **Python**, which help analyze data, automate tasks, and identify security trends.


## **Common Tools**

### Logs

- **Definition**: Logs are records of events within an organization’s systems.
- **Examples**: Employee logins, web service access.
- **Purpose**: Logs help identify vulnerabilities and potential security breaches.

### SIEM Tools

- **Definition**: Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tools collect and analyze log data to monitor security events in real-time.
- **Function**: Reduce manual log analysis by generating alerts for threats and risks to help security analysts detect and respond to security incidents quickly.


#### Hosting Options

- **On-premise**: More control but requires expertise to manage.
- **Cloud-based**: Easier to set up and maintain.


#### Common SIEM tools

- **Splunk**: Self-hosted SIEM platform for log retention, analysis, and search.
- **Chronicle**: Google’s cloud-native SIEM tool with rapid feature deployment.

### Playbooks

- **Definition**: Manuals detailing operational actions for handling security incidents.
- **Purpose**: Guide analysts through standardized processes and procedures. They **help maintain consistency, prevent errors, and ensure legal compliance** in security investigations.

#### Playbook Examples

1. **Chain of Custody Playbook**
   - Documents how digital evidence is handled.
   - Tracks **who, what, where, and why** for all collected evidence.
   - Ensures evidence is **secure and properly transferred**.

2. **Protecting and Preserving Evidence Playbook**
   - Guides analysts in handling **fragile and volatile digital evidence**.
   - Follows the **order of volatility** (prioritizing data that may be lost if a device is powered off).
   - Ensures data integrity by **creating forensic copies** for analysis.

### Network Protocol Analyzers (Packet Sniffers)

- **Definition**: Tools that capture and analyze network traffic.
- **Function**: Monitor network activity to detect potential security threats.

#### Common Network Protocol Analyzers

- **tcpdump** – A command-line tool for capturing network packets.
- **Wireshark** – GUI-based network protocol analyzer for detailed traffic inspection.

These tools help analysts **identify unauthorized data transfers, detect network intrusions, and troubleshoot security issues**.


## **Programming Languages and Operating Systems**

### Programming Languages

- **Definition**: The process of creating specific instructions for a computer to execute tasks.
- **Function**: Used to automate tasks, increase efficiency, and reduce human error.

#### Common Programming Languages

- **Python** – Used for scripting security tasks, automating processes, and analyzing data.
- **SQL (Structured Query Language)** – Used to interact with databases and enables security analysts to automate repetitive tasks, reduce human error, and process large amounts of data efficiently.



### Operating Systems

- **Definition**: The interface between computer hardware and the user.
- **Usage**: Security analysts use Operating Systems to analyze logs, manage systems, and conduct security operations.

- **Examples**:
  - **Linux**: Open-source system widely used in security operations, relying on a command-line interface.
  - **macOS and Windows**: Other operating systems used with different functionalities and user experiences.

#### Key OS for Security Analysts

- **Linux** – An open-source OS that relies on a command-line interface (CLI) for system interactions. Analysts use Linux commands to **analyze logs, monitor network activity, and manage security configurations**.

Unlike macOS and Windows, Linux is **highly customizable**, making it a preferred choice for cybersecurity professionals.

### Additional Security Tools

#### Web Vulnerabilities

- **Definition**: Flaws in web applications that can be exploited by threat actors.
- **Purpose**: Can allow unauthorized access, data theft, or malware deployment.
- **Resource**: Stay informed about these risks using  the [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/) for the latest web security risks.

#### Antivirus Software (anti-malware)

- **Definition**: Software designed to prevent, detect, and eliminate malware.
- **Function**: Scans device memory for malicious patterns and threats.

#### Intrusion Detection System (IDS)

- **Definition**: A system that monitors network activity and alerts on potential intrusions.
- **Function**: Scans and analyzes network packets for unauthorized access or threats.

#### Encryption

- **Definition**: The process of converting plaintext data into secure ciphertext.
  - **Plaintext** – Readable data before encryption.
  - **Ciphertext** – Encrypted data that requires decryption for access.
- **Function**: Ensures confidentiality by making sure that even if data is intercepted, it remains unreadable to unauthorized users.
- **Distinction**: Encryption differs from encoding, which is designed for data representation rather than security.

#### Penetration Testing (Pen Testing)

- **Definition**: Simulated cyberattacks used to identify security vulnerabilities.
- **Function**: Helps organizations assess weaknesses in networks, systems, and applications.

## **Security Governance and Compliance**

- **Confidentiality**: Ensuring only authorized users access sensitive data.
- **Privacy Protection**: Safeguarding personally identifiable information (PII) and sensitive PII (SPII).
- **Legal Compliance**: Adhering to regulations such as HIPAA for patient data protection.

## **Forensic Investigation and Evidence Handling**

- **Chain of Custody**: Tracks evidence possession and control throughout an investigation.
- **Order of Volatility**: A sequence outlining the order of data that must be preserved from first to last.
- **Data Preservation**: The process of properly working with fragile and volatile digital evidence.
