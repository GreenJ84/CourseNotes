## **Cybersecurity Portfolio**

### Overview

Throughout this certificate program, you will have multiple opportunities to develop a professional cybersecurity portfolio to showcase your security skills and knowledge. A portfolio is an essential tool for demonstrating your cybersecurity expertise to potential employers. This document outlines the importance of a cybersecurity portfolio and provides guidance on different hosting options.

### What is a Cybersecurity Portfolio?

A cybersecurity portfolio is a collection of materials that demonstrate your security education, skills, and knowledge. It is more comprehensive than a resume and allows you to showcase your passion and qualifications for a cybersecurity career. While resumes provide a brief summary of experience and skills, a portfolio includes detailed projects, documentation, and evidence of your expertise.

### Portfolio Hosting Options

There are multiple ways to create and store your cybersecurity portfolio:

#### **Option 1: Documents Folder**

- A locally stored folder on your computer where you manage subfolders for different portfolio components (e.g., resume, certifications, project documents, cybersecurity tools, programming work).
- **Setup:** Create a folder and organize files systematically. Ensure frequent backups for security.

#### **Option 2: Cloud Storage (Google Drive/Dropbox)**

- A cloud-based option that allows easy sharing and automatic updates when changes are made.
- **Setup:** Upload your documents to a structured folder and configure sharing settings for accessibility.

#### **Option 3: Google Sites (or Similar Web Hosting)**

- A customizable online platform for presenting portfolio materials, featuring responsive design and embedded content.
- **Setup:** Use Google Sites or another website builder to create and host a structured online portfolio with a unique URL.

#### **Option 4: Git Repository (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket)**

- A repository for storing documents, scripts, security tools, and projects with Markdown-based documentation.
- **Setup:** Create a GitHub repository and organize portfolio materials using proper version control practices.

### Portfolio Content and Projects

Throughout the certificate program, you will have opportunities to develop and include various projects in your portfolio, such as:

- Drafting a **professional statement**
- Conducting a **security audit**
- Analyzing **network structure and security**
- Using **Linux commands** for file permissions
- Applying **SQL queries** for security purposes
- Identifying **vulnerabilities for a business**
- Documenting incidents in an **incident handler’s journal**
- Importing and parsing **security-related text files**
- Creating or refining a **cybersecurity-focused resume**

**Note:** Do not include private, copyrighted, or proprietary documents in your portfolio. If using an online hosting option, keep your portfolio private until it is finalized.

### Key Takeaways

- A well-structured cybersecurity portfolio strengthens job applications.
- Choose a hosting method that aligns with your needs and career goals.
- Regularly update your portfolio to reflect new skills and experiences.
- Maintain a professional, organized presentation to impress potential employers.

By proactively developing a polished cybersecurity portfolio, you enhance your chances of securing opportunities in the cybersecurity field.
