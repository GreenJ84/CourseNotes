This module will take you through key events in cybersecurity history and provide an overview of the eight security domains, laying the foundation for understanding how to protect against future threats.

## **Common Attacks and Their Effectiveness**

### Phishing

Phishing is the use of digital communications to trick people into revealing sensitive data or deploying malicious software.

Some of the most common types of phishing attacks include:

- **Business Email Compromise (BEC):** A threat actor impersonates a known source to make a seemingly legitimate request for financial or sensitive information.
- **Spear Phishing:** A malicious email attack targeting specific users or groups, appearing to come from a trusted source.
- **Whaling:** A specialized form of spear phishing targeting company executives to gain access to sensitive data.
- **Vishing:** The use of voice communication to impersonate a known source and extract sensitive information.
- **Smishing:** The use of text messages to trick users into revealing sensitive information or deploying malware.

### Malware

Malware is software designed to harm devices or networks. Threat actors use malware for financial gain or intelligence advantages against individuals, organizations, or territories.

Common types of malware attacks include:

- **Viruses:** Malicious code that disrupts operations and damages data or software. A virus requires user interaction (such as opening an infected file) to spread.
- **Worms:** Self-replicating malware that spreads across networks without user action.
- **Ransomware:** Threat actors encrypt an organization’s data and demand payment to restore access.
- **Spyware:** Malware designed to secretly collect and sell user data, such as emails, texts, recordings, and location information.

### Social Engineering

Social engineering is a manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private information, access, or valuables. Threat actors create an environment of false trust to exploit as many people as possible.

Common types of social engineering attacks include:

- **Social Media Phishing:** Collecting personal details from social media to initiate an attack.
- **Watering Hole Attack:** Compromising a website frequently visited by a specific group of users.
- **USB Baiting:** Leaving a malware-infected USB drive in a location where an employee might pick it up and plug it into a system.
- **Physical Social Engineering:** Impersonating an employee, customer, or vendor to gain unauthorized access to a physical location.

#### Social Engineering Principles

Social engineering is highly effective because people are naturally trusting and conditioned to respect authority. With the rise of social media, people increasingly prioritize convenience over security, making them more vulnerable to these attacks.

#### Reasons Why Social Engineering Attacks Are Effective

- **Authority:** Threat actors impersonate authority figures to exploit trust.
- **Intimidation:** Using fear or pressure to manipulate victims into compliance.
- **Consensus/Social Proof:** Exploiting the tendency to follow the crowd by claiming others have already granted access or taken an action.
- **Scarcity:** Creating urgency by suggesting limited availability of goods or services.
- **Familiarity:** Establishing a fake emotional connection to gain trust.
- **Trust:** Developing long-term relationships with victims to extract information.
- **Urgency:** Pressuring victims into acting quickly without questioning.

## **Evolution of Early Cyber Attacks**

The security industry is constantly evolving, but many modern attacks are variations of past methods. Understanding historical attacks helps security analysts investigate and respond to incidents effectively.

### Early Malware Attacks

Early attacks like the Brain virus and the Morris worm shaped the modern security industry, leading to structured security frameworks and response teams. Up next, we'll explore how cyber threats have evolved in the digital age.

#### The Brain Virus (1986)

Created by the Alvi brothers, the Brain virus was intended to prevent software piracy by tracking illegal copies of medical software. However, it spread uncontrollably:

- It infected any computer running a pirated copy of the software.
- Any disk inserted into the infected computer also became infected.
- The virus spread globally within months, significantly impacting business productivity.

This attack emphasized the need for structured security strategies to maintain system integrity and prevent unintentional disruptions.

#### The Morris Worm (1988)

Robert Morris developed a program to estimate the size of the internet by self-replicating across computers. However, a design flaw caused it to:

- Continuously reinstall itself on infected systems.
- Overload system memory, causing widespread crashes.
- Affect 6,000 computers—about 10% of the internet at the time.
- Cause millions of dollars in damages due to business disruptions and removal efforts.

As a response, **Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs®)** were created to handle security incidents. Today, CERTs play a critical role in cybersecurity operations, including detection and response.

### The Digital Age and Internet-Based Threats

With the expansion of reliable high-speed internet, cyber threats evolved as attackers no longer needed physical disks to spread malware. Instead, they leveraged the internet to execute large-scale attacks. Two notable examples are the **LoveLetter attack** and the **Equifax breach**.

#### LoveLetter Attack (2000)

Onel De Guzman created the **LoveLetter** malware to steal internet login credentials. The attack exploited email communications and social engineering:

- Users received an email with the subject **"I Love You"** and an attachment labeled **"Love Letter For You."**
- Opening the attachment triggered the malware, which scanned the user's address book and sent itself to all contacts.
- The malware installed a program to collect user credentials and passwords.

The LoveLetter attack infected **45 million computers worldwide**, causing over **$10 billion in damages**. This was one of the first large-scale **social engineering** attacks, a technique that manipulates human behavior to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information.

##### Rise of Social Engineering Attacks

The success of the LoveLetter attack demonstrated the power of social engineering. Since then, cybercriminals have increasingly relied on this method, especially through **phishing**, where malicious emails trick users into revealing sensitive data or installing malware.

With the rise of social media and digital convenience, people often prioritize accessibility over security, increasing their vulnerability to manipulation. Security professionals play a crucial role in educating users about these risks by conducting regular **cybersecurity awareness training**.

#### The Equifax Data Breach (2017)

In 2017, attackers infiltrated Equifax, one of the largest credit reporting agencies, in a **massive data breach** that exposed **over 143 million customer records**—affecting approximately **40% of all Americans**. Stolen data included:

- **Personally identifiable information (PII)** such as social security numbers, birth dates, and driver's license numbers.
- **Financial data**, including home addresses and credit card numbers.

The breach resulted from multiple security failures, as Equifax neglected to patch **known vulnerabilities** in its systems. In response, the U.S. government imposed a **$575 million settlement**, serving as a wake-up call for businesses to invest in **preventative security measures**.

## **Introduction to Security Domains**

As threat actors evolve, security professionals must adapt. Understanding core security concepts is essential for growth in the field. These concepts are organized into **security domains**, which define different areas of cybersecurity work. As of 2022, **CISSP** has established **eight security domains**. Gaps in one domain can negatively impact an entire organization.
