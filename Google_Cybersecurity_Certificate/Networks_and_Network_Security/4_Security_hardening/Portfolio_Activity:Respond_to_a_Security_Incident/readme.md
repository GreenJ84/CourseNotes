# **NIST CSF Security Incident Response**

## **Overview**

In this activity, you will create an incident report analyzing a network security event using the National Institute of Standards and Technology's Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF). The CSF provides a structured approach to managing cybersecurity risks, helping organizations identify vulnerabilities, improve security measures, and respond effectively to incidents. By completing this activity, you will gain experience in applying the CSF to real-world scenarios, improving communication with stakeholders, and strengthening security strategies.

## **Scenario**

You are a cybersecurity analyst for a multimedia company that provides web design, graphic design, and social media marketing services. Recently, your organization experienced a **DDoS attack**, which disrupted internal network services for two hours due to an overwhelming flood of ICMP packets. As a result, normal traffic was unable to access network resources.

The incident management team responded by blocking incoming ICMP packets, shutting down non-critical network services, and restoring essential operations. Upon investigation, the cybersecurity team determined that an **unconfigured firewall** allowed the attack to succeed. To prevent future incidents, the organization implemented new firewall rules, source IP verification, network monitoring software, and an IDS/IPS system to filter suspicious traffic.

Your task is to create a security improvement plan based on this event, following the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**.
