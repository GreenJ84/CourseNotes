# **Network Hardening for Social Media Organization**

## **Overview**

In this activity, you will analyze a scenario involving a social media organization that recently suffered a data breach due to undetected vulnerabilities. Your task is to identify common network hardening tools and practices, select specific methods to address the organization's vulnerabilities, and explain how these methods will enhance security and prevent future breaches.

## **Scenario**

You are a security analyst for a social media organization that experienced a data breach, compromising customer personal information. After reviewing the network, you identify four major vulnerabilities:

1. Employees share passwords.
2. The admin password for the database is set to the default.
3. Firewalls lack traffic filtering rules.
4. Multifactor authentication (MFA) is not used.

If these vulnerabilities are not addressed, the organization faces the risk of further breaches and attacks. In this activity, you will create a security risk assessment and propose network hardening practices to secure the organizationâ€™s network.

## **Instructions**

### Step 1: Access the template

- Use the provided link to access the **[Security Risk Assessment Report](./Risk-assessment-report-template.docx)** template.

### Step 2: Access the supporting materials

- Review the **[Network Hardening Tools](./Network-hardening-tools.xlsx)** materials to help you choose effective solutions.

### Step 3: Select up to 3 hardening tools and methods to implement

- Choose appropriate network hardening tools and methods to address the identified vulnerabilities. Consider techniques like port filtering, network access control, and encryption.

### Step 4: Provide and explain recommendations

- Recommend one or two security hardening practices, explaining why they are effective for each vulnerability. Discuss the frequency of their implementation and how they will protect the network in the future.

## **What to Include in Your Response**

- 1-3 network hardening tools and methods.
- The reasons why the tools and methods selected are effective.

## **Key Takeaways**

As a security analyst, you may be responsible for initiating network security practices. Making executive decisions about which tools to use based on what you know about certain vulnerabilities will be a starting point for helping the organization improve its network security. Explaining and documenting your decisions as a cybersecurity analyst will help in the future if the network ever needs to be troubleshooted. It will also help give non-technical employees buy-in and help them follow security practices, such as multifactor authentication.
