## Part 1: Selected Hardening Tools and Methods

To strengthen the security of the social media organization and prevent future data breaches, the following three network hardening methods will be implemented:

1. **Multifactor Authentication (MFA)** – MFA enhances security by requiring users to verify their identity using multiple authentication factors, such as passwords, OTPs, or biometrics.
2. **Firewall Maintenance** – Regular firewall rule updates help control incoming and outgoing network traffic, preventing unauthorized access and mitigating risks such as DDoS attacks.
3. **Password Policies** – Implementing password policies based on NIST recommendations, such as salting and hashing passwords, will improve credential security and prevent brute-force attacks.

## Part 2: Explanation of Recommendations

**Multifactor Authentication (MFA)** is an essential security measure that protects against unauthorized access, even if a password is compromised. By requiring additional verification methods, MFA reduces the likelihood of credential-based attacks and social engineering threats. It is a one-time setup with ongoing maintenance to ensure users have secure authentication options.

**Firewall Maintenance** ensures that security configurations remain updated, blocking malicious traffic before it reaches internal systems. Regular rule adjustments will help prevent unauthorized access and respond to evolving threats. By filtering inbound and outbound traffic, the organization can limit attack surfaces and reduce exposure to potential cyber threats.

**Password Policies** strengthen user authentication by enforcing modern security measures such as salting and hashing passwords. This reduces the effectiveness of brute-force attacks and prevents attackers from easily guessing passwords. Implementing strong password policies will help secure user accounts and minimize the risks associated with shared or weak passwords.

By implementing these security hardening measures, the organization will significantly reduce its vulnerability to cyber threats, ensuring the protection of customer data and overall network security.

## **Report**

To address the recent data breach and strengthen the organization’s security, three key network hardening measures will be implemented: Multifactor Authentication (MFA), Firewall Maintenance, and Password Policies. MFA enhances security by requiring multiple authentication factors, reducing the risk of unauthorized access even if credentials are compromised. Firewall Maintenance ensures that security configurations are regularly updated, filtering network traffic to prevent unauthorized access and mitigate threats like DDoS attacks. Password Policies, following NIST recommendations, improve credential security by enforcing salting and hashing, preventing brute-force attacks and reducing the risks associated with weak or shared passwords.

Implementing these measures will significantly enhance the organization's network security. MFA adds an extra layer of protection against credential-based attacks, Firewall Maintenance helps control traffic and block threats before they reach internal systems, and strong Password Policies ensure better authentication security. Together, these practices will help prevent future breaches, protect customer data, and establish a more resilient security posture for the organization.
