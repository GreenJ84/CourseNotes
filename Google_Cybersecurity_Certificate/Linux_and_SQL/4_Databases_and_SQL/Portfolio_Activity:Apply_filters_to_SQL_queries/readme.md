# **SQL Portfolio Document: Investigating Security Issues**

## **Overview**

In this activity, you will create a portfolio document to showcase your experience using SQL for security investigations. This document can be included in your cybersecurity portfolio to demonstrate your ability to filter and analyze data using SQL queries. The activity builds upon the **Filter with AND, OR, and NOT** lab, where you used SQL operators to retrieve specific records. You will explain the queries performed in that lab and document your findings, which will help in job interviews and cybersecurity assessments.

## **Scenario**

As a security professional at a large organization, part of your role is to investigate security issues related to **login attempts** and **employee machines**. Recently, you identified potential security threats involving unauthorized access attempts. To analyze these incidents, you will query the company's **employees** and **log_in_attempts** tables, applying SQL filters to extract relevant data. Your goal is to investigate and document the findings, helping to reinforce security measures.

## **Instructions**


### Step 1: Access the Template

- Open the provided **[Apply filters to SQL queries](./Apply_filters_to_SQL_queries.docx)** template to document the activity steps.

### Step 2: Access Supporting Materials

- The **[Instructions for including SQL queries](./Instructions_for_including_SQL_queries.docx)** document provides instructions and best practices for including samples of SQL queries in your portfolio activity.

- The **[Table formats](./Table_formats.docx)** document describes how the tables used for this portfolio activity are organized.

### Step 3: Retrieve after hours failed login attemps

- You recently discovered a potential security incident that occurred after business hours. To investigate this, you need to query the log_in_attempts table and review after hours login activity. Use filters in SQL to create a query that identifies all failed login attempts that occurred after 18:00.
- Describe your query and how it works in the Retrieve after hours failed login attempts section of the Apply filters to SQL queries template. Type this query directly into the template.

### Step 4: Retrieve login attempts on specific dates

- A suspicious event occurred on 2022-05-09. To investigate this event, you want to review all login attempts which occurred on this day and the day before. Use filters in SQL to create a query that identifies all login attempts that occurred on 2022-05-09 or 2022-05-08. Type this query directly into the template.
- Describe your query and how it works in the Retrieve login attempts on specific dates section of the Apply filters to SQL queries template.

### Step 5: Retrieve login attempts outside of Mexico

- There’s been suspicious activity with login attempts, but the team has determined that this activity didn't originate in Mexico. Now, you need to investigate login attempts that occurred outside of Mexico. Use filters in SQL to create a query that identifies all login attempts that occurred outside of Mexico. Type this query directly into the template.
- Describe your query and how it works in the Retrieve login attempts on specific dates section of the Apply filters to SQL queries template.

### Step 6: Retrieve employees in Marketing

- Your team wants to perform security updates on specific employee machines in the Marketing department. You’re responsible for getting information on these employee machines and will need to query the employees table. Use filters in SQL to create a query that identifies all employees in the Marketing department for all offices in the East building. Type this query directly into the template.
- Describe your query and how it works in the Retrieve employees in Marketing section of the Apply filters to SQL queries template.

### Step 7: Retrieve employees in Finance or Sales

- Your team now needs to perform a different security update on machines for employees in the Sales and Finance departments. Use filters in SQL to create a query that identifies all employees in the Sales or Finance departments. Type this query directly into the template.
- Describe your query and how it works in the Retrieve employees in Finance or Sales section of the Apply filters to SQL queries template.

### Step 8: Retrieve all employees not in IT

- Your team needs to make one more update to employee machines. The employees who are in the Information Technology department already had this update, but employees in all other departments need it. Use filters in SQL to create a query which identifies all employees not in the IT department. Type this query directly into the template.
- Describe your query and how it works in the Retrieve all employees not in IT section of the Apply filters to SQL queries template.

### Step 9: Finalize your document

- To finalize the document and make its purpose clear to potential employers, be sure to complete the Project description and Summary sections of the Apply filters to SQL queries template.
  - In the Project description section, give a general overview of the scenario and what you accomplish through SQL. Write two to four sentences.
  - In the Summary section, provide a short summary of the previous tasks and connect them to the scenario. Write approximately two to four sentences.

### Step 10: Assess Your Activity

- Complete the self-assessment by answering yes or no to each statement to review your work:
  - Include screenshots or typed versions of your commands. (1pt)y/n
  - Describe the project at the beginning of the document. (1pt)y/n
  - Provide explanations for your queries and their outputs. (1pt)y/n
  - Include a summary at the end of the document. (1pt)y/n
  - Include details on using LIKE to search for a pattern. (1pt)y/n
  - Your document includes details on filtering for dates and times. (1pt)y/n
  - Your document includes details on using AND and OR to filter on multiple conditions. (1pt)y/n
  - Your document includes details on using NOT in filters. (1pt)y/n
