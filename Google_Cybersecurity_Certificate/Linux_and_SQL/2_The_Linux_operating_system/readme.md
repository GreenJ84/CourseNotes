## **Learning Objectives**

- Explain why **Linux is widely used in cybersecurity**.
- Describe the **architecture** of the Linux operating system.
- Identify **key features** of different Linux distributions.
- Understand how the **Linux shell** provides an interface for interacting with the OS.

## **Introduction to Linux**

### What is Linux?

Linux is the most widely used **operating system in cybersecurity**. It is an **open-source OS**, meaning anyone can access, modify, and share its source code.

#### The History of Linux

- **Linus Torvalds** created the **Linux kernel** in the early 1990s as an improvement on UNIX.
- **Richard Stallman** developed **GNU**, an open-source OS also based on UNIX.
- Combining **Torvalds’ kernel** with **GNU’s software** led to what we now call **Linux**.

#### Why is Linux Unique?

- **Open-source**: Licensed under the **GNU Public License**, allowing modification and distribution.
- **Community-driven**: Developers worldwide contribute to its improvement.
- **Multiple distributions**: Over **600 Linux distributions** exist, each tailored for different needs.

### Linux in Cybersecurity

- **Log analysis**: Security analysts use Linux to review system logs for errors or threats.
- **Identity & access management**: Linux helps verify user access and authorization.
- **Specialized distributions**: Some Linux versions are built for **digital forensics** and **penetration testing**.

### Linux Architecture

Linux is composed of several key components:

#### 1. User

The **user** initiates and manages tasks. **Linux is a multi-user system**, meaning multiple users can access resources simultaneously.

#### 2. Applications

Applications perform specific tasks (e.g., word processors, web browsers).

- Linux applications are managed through **package managers**, which help install, update, and remove software.

#### 3. Shell

The **shell** is a **command-line interpreter (CLI)** that processes and executes commands.

- It serves as a translator between the **user** and the **kernel**.

#### 4. Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS)

The **FHS** organizes data in a structured format, similar to a filing cabinet.

- It defines how files, directories, and system data are stored.

#### 5. Kernel

The **kernel** manages processes and memory, communicating with hardware to execute commands.

- It ensures **efficient resource allocation** and system stability.

#### 6. Hardware

Hardware refers to the **physical components** of a computer, divided into:

- **Internal hardware**: Essential components like the **CPU, RAM, and hard drive**.
- **Peripheral devices**: Non-essential components like **monitors, printers, and keyboards**.

## **Linux Distributions**

### What are Linux Distributions?

Linux is highly customizable, and different **versions** of Linux, called **distributions (distros)**, exist for different needs. Each distribution includes:

- The **Linux kernel**
- Pre-installed **utilities and applications**
- A **package management system**
- An **installer**

Understanding the **distribution** you're using is essential, as different distros offer unique tools and applications.

#### Linux Distributions Analogy

Think of Linux as a **vehicle**, with the **kernel as the engine**. Different manufacturers create **various types of vehicles** (trucks, buses, cars) from the same engine. Similarly, different **Linux distributions** are built on the Linux kernel and customized for different purposes.

#### Parent and Derived Distributions

Most Linux distros are derived from a **parent distribution**:

- **Debian** → **Ubuntu, Kali Linux, Parrot**
- **Red Hat** → **CentOS, AlmaLinux**
- **Slackware** → **SUSE**

### Common Linux Distributions in Security

#### Kali Linux

- **Debian-based**, designed for **penetration testing** and **digital forensics**.
- Includes **pre-installed security tools** such as:
  - **Metasploit** – Exploit vulnerabilities.
  - **Burp Suite** – Test web application security.
  - **John the Ripper** – Crack passwords.
  - **tcpdump** – Capture network traffic.
  - **Wireshark** – Analyze live/captured network traffic.
  - **Autopsy** – Forensic analysis of hard drives and mobile devices.
- Best used in a **virtual machine (VM)** to prevent unintended system modifications.

#### Ubuntu

- **User-friendly**, with both a **GUI and CLI**.
- Includes **pre-installed applications** and supports additional **security tools**.
- Popular in **cloud computing** and widely used in enterprises.

#### Parrot OS

- **Debian-based** like Kali Linux.
- Includes **penetration testing** and **digital forensics** tools.
- Offers a **user-friendly GUI** alongside a **CLI**.

#### Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)

- **Subscription-based, enterprise-focused** distribution.
- Not free but includes **dedicated customer support**.

#### AlmaLinux

- Created as a **stable replacement for CentOS**.
- Designed to be **binary-compatible with RHEL**, ensuring seamless migration.

### Package Managers for Linux Distributions

#### What is a Package Manager?

A **package** is software that includes **dependencies** needed for installation. A **package manager**:

- Installs, updates, and removes software.
- Resolves dependency issues.

#### Types of Package Managers

- **Debian-based distros (Ubuntu, Kali, Parrot)** → Use **dpkg** and **APT (Advanced Package Tool)**.
- **Red Hat-based distros (RHEL, AlmaLinux)** → Use **RPM (Red Hat Package Manager)** and **YUM (Yellowdog Updater Modified)**.

#### Key Differences

- **Debian packages** use `.deb` files (e.g., `Package_Version-Release_Architecture.deb`).
- **Red Hat packages** use `.rpm` files (e.g., `Package-Version-Release_Architecture.rpm`).

## **The Shell**

### What is the Shell?

The **shell** is the **command-line interpreter** of the Linux operating system. It allows users to:

- **Enter commands** to interact with the OS.
- **Send instructions** to the kernel for execution.
- **Automate tasks** by connecting different operations.

The shell acts as a **translator** between the user and the system, enabling command execution without directly interacting with **binary code**.

### Types of Shells

Linux supports multiple **shells**, each with unique features:

- **Bash (Bourne-Again Shell)** – Default shell in most Linux distributions, widely used in cybersecurity.
- **C Shell (csh)** – Includes C-like syntax.
- **Korn Shell (ksh)** – Advanced scripting capabilities.
- **Enhanced C Shell (tcsh)** – Improved version of C Shell.
- **Z Shell (zsh)** – Offers advanced features like auto-completion.

#### Bash: The Default Shell

- **User-friendly** and supports scripting.
- **Default shell** in most Linux distributions.
- **Commonly used** by cybersecurity professionals.

### Communicating with the Shell

The shell processes **commands** and handles three types of interactions:

#### 1. Standard Input (stdin)

- Input **received from the user** via the command line.
- Example:

  ```bash
  # Writing the command to shell is input
  echo "Hello, world!"
  ```

#### 2. Standard Output (stdout)

- Response **received from the OS** output to the shell.
- Example:

  ```bash
  # echo "Hello, world!"

  # Repsone written to the shell from the OS
  Hello, world!
  ```

#### 3. Standard Error (stderr)

- Error messages **received from the OS** when a command fails output to the shell.
- Example:

  ```bash
  eco "Hello, world!"

  # Error written to the shell from the OS
  bash: eco: command not found
  ```
