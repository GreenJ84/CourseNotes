# **GUI vs. CLI: Choosing the Right Interface**

## **Scenario 1: Changing Passwords for Employees**

**Recommended Interface:** **GUI**
**Reasoning:** A GUI is more user-friendly for employees with different technical backgrounds. It provides a visual, step-by-step approach that is easier to follow, reducing confusion and ensuring all employees can successfully update their passwords.

## **Scenario 2: Renaming Multiple Log Files**


**Recommended Interface:** **CLI**
**Reasoning:** A CLI allows batch renaming using commands like `mv`, `rename`, or scripts, making the process faster and more efficient than manually renaming each file through a GUI. This approach saves time and reduces errors.

## **Scenario 3: Installing Multiple Applications**

**Recommended Interface:** **CLI**
**Reasoning:** The CLI enables logging of installation commands, allowing for easy review and troubleshooting. Commands can be recorded in a history file (`history` command in Linux or PowerShell transcript in Windows), ensuring that all applications are installed correctly and consistently.
