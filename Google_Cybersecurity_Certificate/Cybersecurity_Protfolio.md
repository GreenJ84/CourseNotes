# **Cybersecurity Portfolio**

## **Overview**

Throughout this certificate program, you will have multiple opportunities to develop a professional cybersecurity portfolio to showcase your security skills and knowledge. A portfolio is an essential tool for demonstrating your cybersecurity expertise to potential employers. This document outlines the importance of a cybersecurity portfolio and provides guidance on different hosting options.

## **What is a Cybersecurity Portfolio?**

A cybersecurity portfolio is a collection of materials that demonstrate your security education, skills, and knowledge. It is more comprehensive than a resume and allows you to showcase your passion and qualifications for a cybersecurity career. While resumes provide a brief summary of experience and skills, a portfolio includes detailed projects, documentation, and evidence of your expertise.

## **Portfolio Hosting Options**

There are multiple ways to create and store your cybersecurity portfolio:

### Option 1: Documents Folder

- A locally stored folder on your computer where you manage subfolders for different portfolio components (e.g., resume, certifications, project documents, cybersecurity tools, programming work).
- **Setup:** Create a folder and organize files systematically. Ensure frequent backups for security.

### Option 2: Cloud Storage (Google Drive/Dropbox)

- A cloud-based option that allows easy sharing and automatic updates when changes are made.
- **Setup:** Upload your documents to a structured folder and configure sharing settings for accessibility.

### Option 3: Google Sites (or Similar Web Hosting)

- A customizable online platform for presenting portfolio materials, featuring responsive design and embedded content.
- **Setup:** Use Google Sites or another website builder to create and host a structured online portfolio with a unique URL.

### Option 4: Git Repository (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket)

- A repository for storing documents, scripts, security tools, and projects with Markdown-based documentation.
- **Setup:** Create a GitHub repository and organize portfolio materials using proper version control practices.
