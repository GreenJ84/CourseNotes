# **Finalize Your Incident Handler's Journal**

In this activity, you will finalize the incident handler's journal that you've been working on throughout this course. You'll then add this document to your cybersecurity portfolio, which can be shared with prospective employers or recruiters.

You may recall completing your first journal entry earlier in the course. As you progressed, you used the journal to document your learning journey and apply cybersecurity concepts. By now, you likely have multiple entries, which are valuable additions to your professional portfolio.

Before proceeding, ensure you complete this activity and answer the accompanying questions. A completed exemplar will be provided in the next course item for comparison.

## **Scenario**

You are a cybersecurity professional refining your incident handler's journal to showcase your skills and learning experiences. This journal will serve as part of your professional portfolio, demonstrating your ability to document incidents, use cybersecurity tools, and reflect on your growth.

## **Instructions**

### Step 1: Access Your Incident Handler's Journal

- Open your saved incident handler's journal.
- If you haven't started one, use the provided template: **[Incident handler's journal](./Incident-handler-s-journal.docx)**.

### Step 2: Review Your Journal Entries

- Ensure all entries are complete. If missing any, revisit relevant course activities:
  - [Document an incident with an incident handler's journal](../../1_Introduction_to_detection_and_incident_response/Portfolio_Activity:Document_an_incident_with_an_incident_handlers_journal/readme.md)
  - [Investigate a suspicious file hash](../../3_Incident_investigation_and_response/Activity_1:Investigate_a_suspicious_file_hash/)
  - [Use a playbook to respond to an attack](../../3_Incident_investigation_and_response/Activity_2:Use_playbook_to_respond_to_phishing_incident/readme.md)
  - [Review a final report](../../3_Incident_investigation_and_response/Activity_3:Review_a_final_report/readme.md)
  - [Perform a query with Splunk](../Activity_1:Preform_a_query_with_Splunk/readme.md)

- Minimum required entries:
  - **4 dated & numbered entries**, including:
    - **2 entries** documenting an incident investigation (using the **5 W's**)
    - **2 entries** describing a cybersecurity tool
- Check for:
  - Grammar, punctuation, and spelling errors
  - Missing, inaccurate, or incomplete details

### Step 3: Update Your Journal Entries

- For entries documenting an incident:
  - Add a **brief description (20–50 words)** in the *Description* section.
  - Identify the **NIST Incident Response Lifecycle phase(s)** (Preparation; Detection & Analysis; Containment, Eradication & Recovery; Post-Incident Activity) and justify your choice.

### Step 4: Write a Reflection

- In the *Reflections/Notes* section, answer the following (40–60 words per question):
  - Were any activities challenging? Why?
  - How has your understanding of incident detection/response changed?
  - Which tool or concept did you enjoy most? Why?

## **What to Include in Your Response**

- **4 completed journal entries** with:
  - Date, Entry, and Description (50–80 words)
  - **2 entries** with the **5 W's** section filled (4–6 sentences/bullets)
  - **2 entries** outlining a **cybersecurity tool** (3–5 sentences/bullets)
- **Reflections/Notes** addressing all prompts (6–9 sentences/bullets)

*Note: Some entries may cover both tools and incident investigations.*
