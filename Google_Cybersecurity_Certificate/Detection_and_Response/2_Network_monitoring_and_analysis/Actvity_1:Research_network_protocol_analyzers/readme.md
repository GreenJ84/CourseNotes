# **Wireshark and tcpdump Comparison Activity**

In this activity, you'll focus on the two network protocol analyzers: Wireshark and tcpdump. Your goal is to gain a basic understanding of how they work, their features, and their differences and similarities.

Network protocol analyzers (packet sniffers) are tools designed to capture and analyze data traffic within a network, helping security analysts examine and understand network traffic flows.

Complete this activity before moving on—the next course item will provide a completed exemplar for comparison.

## **Scenario**

In your role as a cybersecurity analyst, you have been asked to research the differences and similarities between Wireshark and tcpdump and create a chart outlining your findings.

## **Instructions**

### Step 1: Access the Template

- Use the provided [Diagram Template](./Diagram-template.pptx) for the assignment

### Step 2: Conduct Online Research

- Begin by reviewing official documentation:
  - [tcpdump Resources &amp; Documentation](https://www.tcpdump.org/index.html#documentation)
  - [Wireshark Official User Guide](https://www.wireshark.org/docs/wsug_html/)
- Perform additional searches using terms like:
  - "Wireshark features and functionalities"
  - "tcpdump features and functionalities"
  - "comparison between tcpdump and Wireshark"
- Critically evaluate sources—prioritize official docs, reputable cybersecurity sites, and technical forums.

**Key research questions to consider:**

- What software/equipment is needed? (Open-source vs. proprietary?)
- What type of user interface does each tool use?
- How do analysts typically use each tool? (Recommended scenarios?)
- How do they capture, analyze, and filter traffic?
- Are there limitations or usage considerations?

### Step 3: Fill the Diagram

- After researching, fill the template with:
  - **At least 2 differences** (e.g., capabilities, interfaces, usage scenarios).
  - **At least 3 similarities** between tcpdump and Wireshark.

## **What to Include in Your Response**

Ensure your completed activity includes:

- **2+ differences** between Wireshark and tcpdump.
- **3+ similarities** between the two tools.
