# **Security Incident Documentation Activity**

In this activity, you will review the details of a security incident and document the incident using your incident handler's journal. You will apply your documentation skills to record key information about the scenario, including the 5 W's (Who, What, When, Where, Why). This journal will serve as a reference for future learning and can be added to your cybersecurity portfolio.

## **Scenario**

A small U.S. healthcare clinic experienced a ransomware attack on a Tuesday morning at 9:00 a.m. Employees were unable to access critical files, including medical records, and a ransom note appeared on their computers. The attackers, an organized hacking group, demanded payment in exchange for the decryption key. The breach originated from phishing emails containing malicious attachments, which deployed ransomware after being downloaded. The incident forced the clinic to shut down its systems and seek external assistance.

  - Attacker demand: **Payment for decryption key**

### Step 3: Record a Journal Entry

- Fill in all sections of the journal:
  - **Date**: Actual date of entry (not fictional).
  - **Entry Number**: Start with "1" for your first entry.
