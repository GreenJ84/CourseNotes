# **Introduction to Detection and Response**

This module introduces the fundamentals of incident detection and response. It covers how cybersecurity professionals identify, verify, and manage malicious threats, as well as the tools and processes used throughout the incident response lifecycle. Learners are reintroduced to key frameworks like NIST CSF and begin using an incident handler‚Äôs journal to track investigations.

## **Learning Objectives**

- Explain the lifecycle of an incident
- Determine the roles and responsibilities of incident response teams
- Describe tools used in the documentation, detection, and management of incidents

## **The Incident Response Lifecycle**

### Importance of Frameworks

- Incident response frameworks provide structure and consistency for handling incidents.
- They are customizable and help standardize processes across organizations.

### NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)

- CSF consists of five core functions: **Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover**.
- This course emphasizes the final three stages:
  - **Detect** malicious activity
  - **Respond** appropriately
  - **Recover** systems and services

### NIST Incident Response Lifecycle

- A separate but related NIST framework outlines these four phases:
  1. **Preparation**
  2. **Detection and Analysis**
  3. **Containment, Eradication, and Recovery**
  4. **Post-Incident Activity**
- The process is cyclical, not linear‚Äîsteps may overlap as new information surfaces.

### Defining Security Incidents

- NIST defines a security incident as any occurrence that jeopardizes confidentiality, integrity, or availability‚Äîor violates laws or policies.
- Key distinction:
  - **Events**: Observable occurrences (e.g., login attempts, password resets)
  - **Incidents**: Events that involve unauthorized actions or policy violations
  - **All incidents are events, but not all events are incidents**

### Documenting Incidents

- Analysts must track the **Who, What, When, Where, Why** of each incident.
- Final reports rely on clear documentation of findings and evidence.
- An **incident handler‚Äôs journal** is introduced as a tool to track observations and actions during investigations.

## **Incident Response Operations**

### Team-Based Response

- Effective incident response requires collaboration across **security and non-security professionals**.
- **Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs)** manage incidents, provide resources for response/recovery, and help prevent future events.
- Cross-functional collaboration is key‚Äîe.g., working with legal for compliance or PR for public disclosures.

### CSIRT Roles and Structure

- CSIRTs vary by organization and may be known as CSIRT, IHT, or SIRT.
- Common roles:
  - **Security Analyst**: Investigates alerts, triages issues, escalates critical incidents.
  - **Technical Lead**: Manages technical response (e.g., containment, eradication), aligns with business priorities.
  - **Incident Coordinator**: Oversees incident process, coordinates across departments, maintains communication.
- Other possible roles: Communications Lead, Legal Lead, Planning Lead, etc.

### CSIRT Operations ‚Äì Command, Control, Communication

- **Command**: Leadership and direction.
- **Control**: Managing technical response tasks.
- **Communication**: Keeping all stakeholders informed.
- Clear structure ensures efficient response and reduces confusion.

### Security Operations Center (SOC)

- A **SOC** is a team/unit focused on monitoring and responding to threats. Often a standalone unit or part of a CSIRT.
- Responsible for **blue team activities** like threat monitoring and response.
- SOC Structure:
  - **Tier 1 SOC Analyst (L1)**: Monitors alerts, triages and escalates.
  - **Tier 2 SOC Analyst (L2)**: Deeper investigation, tool configuration.
  - **Tier 3 SOC Lead (L3)**: Advanced detection techniques, team operations.
  - **SOC Manager**: Team leadership, hiring, performance management, reporting to stakeholders.
- Other specialized roles:
  - **Forensic Investigators**: Analyze digital evidence.
  - **Threat Hunters**: Identify new or advanced threats using intelligence.

### Incident Response Plans

- **Incident Response Plan**: Formal document outlining procedures to handle incidents.
- Based on organizational needs (size, mission, industry, etc.).
- Common components:
  - **Procedures**: Step-by-step response guidance.
  - **System Info**: Network diagrams, logging, asset inventory.
  - **Docs**: Contact lists, templates, forms.
- Plans must be **reviewed and tested regularly** using tabletops or simulations.
- Exercises identify process gaps and ensure team familiarity.
