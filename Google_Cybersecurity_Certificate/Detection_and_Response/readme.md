# **Detection and Response**

In this course, you’ll be introduced to the critical functions of detecting and responding to cybersecurity incidents. As threats continue to evolve and increase, it's inevitable that organizations will experience security incidents — whether through data breaches, ransomware, or simple human error. This course focuses on equipping learners with the skills needed to recognize, investigate, and respond effectively to these incidents.

You’ll begin by learning about the incident response lifecycle and the roles within an incident response team. Then, you'll dive into network monitoring, investigation, and the use of industry-standard tools like Wireshark, tcpdump, Suricata, Splunk, and Chronicle. Along the way, you'll gain hands-on experience documenting findings, capturing and analyzing network packets, investigating suspicious activity, and leveraging logs and alerts from detection tools.

By the end of the course, you’ll have developed foundational skills in network analysis and threat response, and be better prepared for real-world cybersecurity challenges.
