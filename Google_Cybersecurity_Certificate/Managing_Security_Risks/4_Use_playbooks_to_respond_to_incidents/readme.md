# **Use Playbooks to Respond to Incidents**

Welcome to the final module of the course.

## **Module Overview**

 In this module, we’ll explore **playbooks** and how they help security teams respond to threats, risks, and vulnerabilities identified by SIEM tools. We’ll also cover the **six phases of incident response**.

## **Learning Objectives**

- Define and describe the purpose of a playbook.
- Use a playbook to respond to identified threats, risks, or vulnerabilities.

## **Security Playbooks**

Previously, we discussed how SIEM tools protect an organization's assets. In this section, we’ll introduce another important security tool: the playbook.

### Playbook Overview

A playbook is a manual outlining operational actions and detailing the tools to use in response to a security incident. It ensures consistency, efficiency, and accuracy in mitigating risks, regardless of the team member handling the case.

Playbooks are "living documents," meaning they are updated to address industry changes, new threats, or failures identified during incidents. They are updated through collaboration among security team members with various expertise.

### Types of Playbooks

- **Incident and Vulnerability Response Playbooks**: These are commonly used by entry-level cybersecurity professionals to handle specific incidents like ransomware or phishing.
- **Other Playbooks**: Security alerts, team-specific, and product-specific playbooks are also developed depending on the organization’s needs.

### Phases of Incident Response Playbooks

Incident response playbooks follow a six-phase process:

1. **Preparation**: Establish procedures, staffing plans, and user education to mitigate risks and prepare for incidents.
2. **Detection and Analysis**: Use tools and processes to detect breaches and analyze their severity.
3. **Containment**: Prevent further damage by containing the incident and minimizing immediate risks.
4. **Eradication and Recovery**: Remove incident artifacts and restore operations to a secure state.
5. **Post-Incident Activity**: Document the incident, inform leadership, and apply lessons learned for future preparedness.
6. **Coordination**: Report incidents and share information based on organizational standards to ensure compliance.

## **Incident Response**

### Playbooks and SIEM Tools

In cybersecurity, playbooks guide security professionals to respond to incidents with urgency and accuracy. They ensure consistency, structure, and compliance, outlining processes for communication and documentation.

#### Using a Playbook with a SIEM Alert

When a SIEM tool generates an alert, such as a potential malware attack, the playbook helps the security analyst take necessary actions:

1. **Assess the Alert**: Validate the alert by analyzing log data and related metrics.
2. **Contain the Incident**: Isolate the infected system to prevent the malware from spreading.
3. **Eliminate Traces and Restore Systems**: Remove traces of the malware and restore systems using clean backups.
4. **Post-Incident Activities**: Document the incident, report to stakeholders, and notify authorities like the FBI if necessary.

#### SOAR Tools

Playbooks are also used with SOAR tools, which automate tasks triggered by SIEM or MDR tools. For example, a SOAR tool might block a user account after multiple failed login attempts, and the analyst then uses a playbook to resolve the issue.


## **Key Takeaways**

- Playbooks provide detailed, consistent actions for security teams to follow during incidents.
- Playbooks are living documents that are updated based on new threats and incidents.
- They help minimize the impact of an incident and protect an organization’s critical assets.
- They minimize errors and support forensic investigations by providing predefined steps.
- Regular updates improve their effectiveness in handling future incidents.
