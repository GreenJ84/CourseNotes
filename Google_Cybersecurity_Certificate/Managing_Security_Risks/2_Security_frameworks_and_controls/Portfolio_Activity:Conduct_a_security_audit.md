   - Recommendations for the IT manager are optional.

### Step 3: Assess Your Activity

After completing the audit, perform a self-assessment with the following criteria:

- You considered risks to Botium Toys’ customers, employees, and/or assets, based on controls and compliance best practices that are or are not currently implemented? **(1 point)**
- You reviewed the control categories document? **(1 point)**
- You selected “yes” or “no” for each control listed? **(1 point)**
- You selected “yes” or “no” for each compliance best practice? **(1 point)**


A total of **5 points** is possible. Aim for **4/5 points (80%)** before moving on. If needed, revise and resubmit your work for a higher score.
