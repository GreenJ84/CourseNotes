This module will focus on security frameworks and controls, with a particular emphasis on NIST's RMF, delve into security audits and discuss some basic security tools that help protect assets and data from various risks.


## **8 CISSP Security Domains**

The eight security domains identified by the Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) help organizations structure security operations, manage risks, and establish a strong security posture. This module covers the key areas of these domains and their relevance to cybersecurity.

### **1. Security and Risk Management**

- Defines security goals and objectives to reduce risks to critical assets and data.
- Covers risk mitigation, compliance, business continuity, and legal regulations.
- Establishes policies for ethical security practices to minimize negligence and fraud.
- Encompasses **Information Security (InfoSec)** strategies such as incident response, vulnerability management, and application security.

### **2. Asset Security**

- Focuses on securing digital and physical assets.
- Manages storage, maintenance, retention, and destruction of data.
- Ensures proper handling of sensitive data such as PII and SPII.
- Implements secure data disposal practices, including proper hard drive destruction.

### **3. Security Architecture and Engineering**

- Ensures the use of effective tools, systems, and processes for data security.
- Promotes **shared responsibility** where all individuals contribute to security.
- Incorporates security design principles such as **least privilege**, **defense in depth**, and **zero trust**.

### **4. Communication and Network Security**

- Manages and secures physical networks and wireless communications.
- Protects data across on-site, remote, and cloud environments.
- Mitigates risks associated with insecure connections like public Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.

### **5. Identity and Access Management (IAM)**

- Controls user access through identification, authentication, authorization, and accountability.
- Implements **least privilege** principles to minimize risk.
- Uses authentication methods such as biometrics and multi-factor authentication (MFA).

### **6. Security Assessment and Testing**

- Conducts security control testing to identify risks and vulnerabilities.
- Implements security audits and penetration testing.
- Evaluates security measures through **security assessment reports**.

### **7. Security Operations**

- Focuses on threat investigation and incident response.
- Uses forensic analysis to determine causes of security incidents.
- Implements **SIEM tools**, intrusion detection, log management, and playbooks for structured responses.

### **8. Software Development Security**

- Integrates security into the **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)**.
- Ensures secure coding practices, penetration testing, and encryption methods.
- Incorporates security reviews at all development phases to mitigate vulnerabilities.

## **Threats, Risks, and Vulnerabilities**

Organizations must protect both digital and physical assets from threats, risks, and vulnerabilities. Assets include PII, intellectual property, IT infrastructure, and physical resources like payment kiosks and office spaces.

### **Risk Management Strategies**

Organizations implement various strategies to manage risks:

- **Acceptance:** Acknowledging a risk without taking action.
- **Avoidance:** Creating plans to eliminate risks altogether.
- **Transference:** Shifting risk to third-party providers.
- **Mitigation:** Reducing the impact of an identified risk.

Frameworks such as the **NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF)** and **HITRUST** help organizations develop policies and processes for risk management.

### **Understanding Threats, Risks, and Vulnerabilities**

### **Threats**

- **Threat:** Any event or action that could negatively impact assets.
- Common threats include:
  - **Insider threats:** Employees or vendors misusing authorized access.
  - **Advanced persistent threats (APTs):** Prolonged unauthorized access to systems.
  - **Social engineering attacks:** Manipulating people to disclose confidential information.
    - **Phishing:** Fraudulent emails designed to steal credentials.

### **Risks**

- **Risk:** The likelihood of a threat exploiting a vulnerability.
- Factors affecting risk levels:
  - **External risks:** Cyberattacks targeting an organization’s data.
  - **Internal risks:** Employees or partners posing security risks.
  - **Legacy systems:** Outdated technology vulnerable to exploitation.
  - **Multiparty risk:** Third-party vendors with access to sensitive data.
  - **Non-compliance:** Failing to update software or apply security patches.

### **Vulnerabilities**

- **Vulnerability:** A weakness that can be exploited by a threat.
- Common vulnerabilities include:
  - **ProxyLogon:** Microsoft Exchange vulnerability allowing unauthorized access.
  - **ZeroLogon:** Weakness in Microsoft's authentication protocol.
  - **Log4Shell:** Java-based vulnerability allowing remote code execution.
  - **PetitPotam:** Windows NTLM relay attack.
  - **Unpatched systems:** Security flaws that remain unaddressed.
  - **Weak access controls:** Insufficient monitoring and logging.

### **Impact of Threats, Risks, and Vulnerabilities on Business Operations**

### **1. Ransomware Attacks**

- **Ransomware:** Malicious software that encrypts data and demands payment for decryption.
- Consequences:
  - Disrupts network operations.
  - Prevents access to critical systems.
  - Can lead to leaked data on the **dark web**.

### **2. Financial Impact**

- Security incidents cause financial losses due to:
  - **Operational downtime.**
  - **Legal penalties for non-compliance.**
  - **Mitigation and recovery costs.**

### **3. Identity Theft**

- Stolen PII and SPII can be sold on the **dark web**, leading to legal and financial repercussions.

### **4. Reputation Damage**

- Breaches affect customer trust and market position.
- Organizations may face regulatory scrutiny and loss of business.

## **NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF)**

The **NIST RMF** outlines structured steps for risk management.

### **1. Prepare**

- Identifies security and privacy risks before incidents occur.
- Analysts monitor threats and suggest preventive measures.

### **2. Categorize**

- Defines risk management processes based on **confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA)** principles.
- Analysts assess risks to critical assets like customer data.

### **3. Select**

- Organizations choose and document security controls.
- Analysts maintain **playbooks and compliance records**.

### **4. Implement**

- Security controls are deployed to mitigate risks.
- Example: Strengthening password policies to prevent unauthorized access.

### **5. Assess**

- Evaluates the effectiveness of security controls.
- Analysts identify weaknesses and recommend improvements.

### **6. Authorize**

- Organizations formally accept responsibility for security measures.
- Analysts assist with **reporting and risk documentation**.

### **7. Monitor**

- Continuous assessment of security effectiveness.
- Analysts track security events and ensure compliance.
