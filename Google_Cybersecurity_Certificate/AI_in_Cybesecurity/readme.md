# **AI in Cybersecurity**

In today’s fast-paced cybersecurity landscape, artificial intelligence (AI) plays a transformative role in helping professionals automate routine tasks, enhance analysis, and streamline communication. This module explores how AI—and specifically generative AI (gen AI)—is being used to improve productivity, strengthen defenses, and make informed decisions.

You’ll learn the foundational concepts of AI, discover tools like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Microsoft Copilot, and explore real-world examples from cybersecurity professionals like Luis, a Cloud Security Architect at Google. This module also emphasizes ethical considerations and responsible usage of AI in security operations, highlighting the dual nature of AI as both a defender and a potential threat.

## **Learning Objectives**

- Learn foundational concepts of AI, generative AI, and how they apply to cybersecurity.
- Discover AI tools used in cybersecurity.
- Exploring how AI can support daily work tasks such as writing code, debugging, researching threats, and understanding security frameworks like NIST 800-53.
- Learning how to write effective prompts using the T-C-R-E-I (Task, Context, References, Evaluate, Iterate) framework.
- Practicing the use of AI in identifying vulnerabilities, enhancing security controls, and improving coding efficiency.

By the end of this module, you'll be equipped with the tools and knowledge to integrate AI into your cybersecurity workflow, responsibly and effectively.

## **The Double-Edged Sword of AI**

AI is both a powerful defense mechanism and a potential threat vector. While it enhances security capabilities, it also introduces new risks:

- Malicious actors may use AI to create advanced, evasive attacks.
- AI systems themselves can become targets for exploitation.

Understanding this dual nature is essential. As a cybersecurity professional, you'll be tasked with securing AI-driven systems while also defending against AI-enhanced threats.

### AI in Action: Security Use Cases

AI is already helping cybersecurity professionals by:

- Detecting threats.
- Automating incident response.
- Streamlining tedious tasks like debugging and policy searching.

> 🎯 Focus your energy on high-impact tasks while AI handles the repetitive ones.

## **Responsible Use of AI**

Always follow a **human-in-the-loop** approach to using AI:

- AI should **augment**, not replace, your expertise.
- Always **verify** AI-generated results.
- Be cautious when inputting **sensitive or confidential data**.
- Follow your organization's **AI policies**.

> ✅ Never enter personal or company-sensitive information into public AI tools without permission.

## **Understand Generative AI**

Generative AI (Gen AI) is a powerful type of artificial intelligence capable of creating new content—like text, images, and other media. Examples of Gen AI tools include:

- **Gemini** (by Google)
- **ChatGPT** (by OpenAI)
- **Microsoft Copilot** (by Microsoft)
- **DeepSeek**

These tools operate through **prompts**—instructions you provide to generate desired outputs.

*Note*: Many other AI platform, tools, and services are being using services and models from these big AI providers.

### Practical Uses of Gen AI in Cybersecurity

As a cybersecurity professional, generative AI can help with both practical and creative tasks. Here are common ways it can boost your productivity:

#### Create Content

- Generate synthetic datasets (e.g., fake data for testing cybersecurity tools).
- Draft documentation or reports.

#### Analyze Information Quickly

- Summarize long reports or meeting transcripts.
- Identify important details faster.

#### Answer Questions

- Use for research and insights (e.g., “What are common ransomware behaviors?”).

#### Simplify Routine Work

- Provide initial analysis of potentially malicious emails.
- Scan code for vulnerabilities or logic errors.

### Prompting Effectively: The T-C-R-E-I Framework

To get the most value from Gen AI tools, craft strong prompts using the **T-C-R-E-I** structure:

| Component | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| **T - Task** | Define what you want the model to do. Include **persona** (e.g., "as a security analyst") and **format** (e.g., bulleted list). |
| **C - Context** | Provide essential background details. Be clear and specific. |
| **R - References** | Add supporting information (e.g., past examples, data, preferences). |
| **E - Evaluate** | Review the output. Did it meet your needs? |
| **I - Iterate** | Refine the prompt and try again to improve results. |


#### Tips for Prompting AI on Frameworks

- Use **natural language** and complete thoughts. Speak to the tool like you would a colleague.
- Add **context** (e.g., non-federal system).
- Ask for a **simplified explanation** if needed (e.g., "Explain this like I’m a new cybersecurity analyst").
- Request **real-world examples**, analogies, or different learning styles (e.g., visual, narrative).
- Use **voice prompting** with tools like Gemini for quicker iteration.

## **Use Generative AI to Work Smarter and Faster**


### Debug Code with AI Tools

Writing and reviewing code is a common task in cybersecurity—especially for automating tasks or analyzing logs.

**Use Case**: Bug Detection with Python Code:

Imagine you wrote a function to flag suspicious login behavior. You ask a Gen AI tool like Gemini:

**Prompt Example:**

```text
What bugs, if any, are in the existing code?
```

You paste your Python script, and the AI responds.

#### AI-Detected Bug: Division by Zero

- **Bug Found:** Division by zero when the average login count is 0 (e.g., a new employee).
- **Fix:** AI recommends adding a conditional check before the division.

#### AI Advantages

- Identifies **bugs** and **edge cases**.
- Offers **fix suggestions** with explanations.
- Saves **time** and **reduces risk** of missing critical issues.

> 🧠 Note: When prompting for **code review**, keep prompts focused. Too much detail may confuse the model.

### Use AI to Improve or Annotate Code

Working with code written by others? Use AI tools to:

- **Add comments** explaining each line.
- **Suggest improvements** for readability, performance, or security.

**Prompt Example:**

```text
I'm a security analyst, and I've been tasked with improving a coding project that my colleague originally worked on, but I have limited experience with Python. Update the code to add comment lines that explain what each section does. Then, suggest key considerations I should keep in mind to improve it.
```

- AI evaluates and **adds comments**.
- Suggests **enhancements** such as better structure, edge-case handling, or error logging.


#### More Coding Support from AI

- Works with many programming languages.
- Can help **write code from scratch**.
- Boosts productivity and helps **new analysts learn coding best practices**.


### Real-World Scenario: Understanding NIST Control SI-5

Security frameworks like **NIST 800-53** guide cybersecurity teams in managing and mitigating risks. However, they can be complex and time-consuming to interpret.

- **Challenge:** Understand and apply **SI-5** (Security Control Monitoring) from NIST 800-53 Rev. 5 to a non-federal system.
- **Goal:** Implement essential controls and assess valuable *enhancements*, even if they are not required.
- **Solution:** Use a Gen AI tool to analyze SI-5 by prompting it with specific context.

**Example Prompt:**

```text
I'm a security analyst and I need help understanding control SI-5 in NIST 800-53 rev 5. What does it ask me to do? How can I implement this control? And what enhancements should I consider adopting? I'm not developing a federal system, but would like high levels of security, so the enhancements are not requirements per se, though they are desirable.
```

### Other Use Cases

- **Understanding vulnerabilities** (e.g., SSRF, injection, broken access control).
- **Investigating alerts** from intrusion detection systems (IDS).
- **Automating code analysis** for security flaws and inefficiencies.
- **Prioritizing threats** based on severity and potential impact.
