# **Conducting a Vulnerability Assessment for a Small Business**

In this activity, you will conduct a vulnerability assessment for a small business. A vulnerability assessment is the internal review process of an organization’s security systems. You will evaluate the risks of a vulnerable information system and outline a remediation plan.

As a cybersecurity analyst, you might help with vulnerability assessments to prevent attacks in an organization. Later, you can add this document to your cybersecurity portfolio, which you can share with prospective employers or recruiters. To review the importance of building a professional portfolio and options for creating your portfolio, review the *Create a cybersecurity portfolio* topic.

Be sure to complete this activity and answer the questions that follow before moving on. The next course item will provide you with a completed exemplar to compare to your own work.

## **Scenario**

You are a newly hired cybersecurity analyst for an e-commerce company. The company stores information on a remote database server since many of the employees work remotely from locations all around the world. Employees of the company regularly query, or request, data from the server to find potential customers. The database has been open to the public since the company's launch three years ago. As a cybersecurity professional, you recognize that keeping the database server open to the public is a serious vulnerability.

You are tasked with completing a vulnerability assessment of the situation to communicate the potential risks to decision-makers at the company. You must create a written report that explains how the vulnerable server is a risk to business operations and how it can be secured.

## **Instructions**

### Part 1 - Open a Report Template

#### Step 1: Access the Template

- Use the following template to construct your written report:
  **[Vulnerability Assessment Report](./Vulnerability-assessment-report-template.docx)**

#### Step 2: Access Supporting Materials

- The following materials will help you complete this activity. Keep them open as you proceed to the next steps. You will use this resource in Part 2 of this activity:
  **[NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1](./NIST-SP-800-30-Rev.-1.docx)**

#### Step 3: Review Information About the Vulnerable Server

- Review the **System Description** and **Scope** of the Vulnerability Assessment Report in the provided template.
- The **System Description** highlights the components, architecture, and dependencies of the system being assessed.
- The **Scope** defines the focus and boundaries of the assessment, such as confidentiality, availability, and integrity of data.

### Part 2 - Perform the Risk Assessment

#### Step 1: Explain the Purpose of the Information System

- Write a **purpose statement** (3-5 sentences, 60-100 words) explaining the importance of securing the database server.
- Consider how the server is valuable to the business, the risks of leaving it unsecured, and the impact of a potential security breach.

#### Step 2: Identify Potential Threat Sources

- Using **NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1**, identify **three potential threats** to the database server.
- List these threats in the **Threat Source** column of the **Risk Assessment Table** in your report template.

#### Step 3: Identify Potential Threat Events

- Identify **three threat events** that could be initiated by the threat sources.
- List these events in the **Threat Event** column of the **Risk Assessment Table** in your report template.

#### Step 4: Calculate the Risk of Potential Threats

- Estimate a **Likelihood Score (1-3)** and **Severity Score (1-3)** for each identified threat.
- Use the formula **Risk Score = Likelihood × Severity** to calculate the overall risk (1-9).
- Record the scores in the **Risk Assessment Table** in your report template.

### Part 3 - Propose Security Recommendations

#### Step 1: Explain Your Approach

- In the **Approach** section of the report, write **3-5 sentences (60-100 words)** explaining why you selected the identified threats and why they are significant business risks.
- Describe your thought process in evaluating the risks, emphasizing the importance of a **qualitative vulnerability assessment** to help stakeholders make informed security decisions.

#### Step 2: Propose a Remediation Strategy

- In the **Remediation** section of your report, write **3-5 sentences (60-100 words)** summarizing specific **security controls** that could be implemented to mitigate or remediate the risks.
- Align your suggestions with the risks identified in the assessment.
- Consider implementing security controls such as:
  - **Principle of least privilege** – Restrict user access based on job roles.
  - **Defense in depth** – Use multiple layers of security measures.
  - **Multi-factor authentication (MFA)** – Strengthen authentication processes.
  - **Authentication, Authorization, Accounting (AAA) framework** – Improve access control and auditing.

#### Step 3: Assess Your Activity

- **Self-assessment:** Use the checklist below to review your work and ensure all elements of the vulnerability assessment are complete.
- Answer **yes or no** to each statement:

  1. Did you provide a purpose statement in the Purpose section?
  2. Did you complete the Risk Assessment section with identified threats and risks?
  3. Did you explain your approach in the Approach section?
  4. Did you propose a remediation or mitigation strategy in the Remediation section?
  5. Did you save a copy of your completed report?
- **Scoring:** Each correct response is worth 1 point, with a total of **5 points possible**.
- The recommended passing score is **at least 80% (4/5 points)**. If needed, revise your project and resubmit to improve your score.

## **What to Include in Your Response**

- A **completed Vulnerability Assessment Report**
- A **Purpose Statement** explaining the importance of securing the database server
- A **Risk Assessment Table** with identified threats, threat events, likelihood, severity, and overall risk scores
- A **justification of the identified risks** in the **Approach** section (3-5 sentences)
- A **remediation and/or mitigation strategy** in the **Remediation** section (3-5 sentences)
