# **Identify attack vectors of a USB**

## **Contents**

The USB drive contains a mix of personal and work-related files. Personal files include family and pet photos, while work-related files include a new hire letter and an employee shift schedule. These files could potentially contain personally identifiable information (PII), such as names, addresses, and employee details. Storing personal files alongside sensitive work-related files can create a security risk, as it increases the chances of accidental exposure or misuse.

## **Attacker Mindset**

An attacker could exploit the information on this USB drive to target Jorge or the hospital. By accessing the new hire letter and employee shift schedule, an attacker could gain insight into hospital operations, employee movements, or potentially target other employees for phishing or social engineering attacks. Additionally, if personal information is used to gain trust or manipulate individuals, it could further compromise the organizationâ€™s security.

## **Risk Analysis**

Malicious software that could be hidden on the USB drive includes viruses, ransomware, or trojans designed to steal credentials or implant backdoors into hospital systems. If the device were infected and discovered by another employee, they might unknowingly infect the hospital's network, compromising sensitive information or systems. A threat actor could find sensitive employee data, which could be used to impersonate individuals or gain unauthorized access to hospital operations, leading to data breaches or further attacks. To mitigate such attacks, implementing USB device control policies, educating employees about USB baiting, and using endpoint security software can reduce the likelihood of infection and data compromise.
