# **Approach cybersecurity with an attacker mindset**

Now that you've been introduced to attack surfaces and attack vectors, you can pause for a moment and think about what you are learning. In this self-reflection, you will think about how these factors can help identify threats and respond to brief questions.

You have learned many skills and concepts in this course. Completing this self-reflection will help you understand how you might use what you’ve learned for different tasks and roles in the security field. Answering and asking questions in this self-reflection will help to reinforce what you’ve learned, so it will be easier for you to remember it later.

## Review the Steps of Applying an Attacker Mindset

Previously, you learned that applying an attacker mindset to any situation starts by asking yourself, “How would I exploit this vector?” This will require you to consider two elements: the attack surface and its attack vectors.

Remember, an attack surface includes all the potential vulnerabilities that a threat actor could exploit. An attack vector is the pathway that an attacker uses to penetrate security defenses of an attack surface.

After considering these elements, you can then go through a step-by-step process to apply an attacker mindset:

1. Identify a target
2. Determine how the target can be accessed
3. Evaluate attack vectors that can be exploited
4. Find the tools and methods of attack

For a refresher on the elements of an attacker mindset, you can review the video on attack vectors and the video on attack surfaces.

## Reflection questions

Consider what you reviewed about applying an attacker mindset in relation to securing your home environment:

### Question 1

What are the attack surfaces of a home? Are they physical or digital? What are their vulnerabilities? Are they currently exposed to risk?

Write 2-3 sentences (40-60 words) that describe important characteristics about the attack surfaces of your home.

---

### Question 2

Now, consider how an attacker might exploit the vulnerabilities of that surface.

What are the attack vectors of this surface? Are there multiple entry points? How might the vulnerabilities be exploited? What defenses exist? Can new defenses be added?

Write 3-5 sentences (60-100 words) that explain what those attack vectors are and how you can apply the tools and/or strategies you’ve learned to protect your home.
