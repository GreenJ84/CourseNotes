# **Data leak summary**

| **Control**              | Least privilege |
|--------------------------|-----------------|
| **Issue(s)**             | The data leak occurred due to the failure to revoke access after a meeting, poor communication about what could be shared, and a mistake in sharing the wrong link to internal documents. Employees did not adhere to the principle of least privilege, leading to unnecessary exposure of sensitive data. |
| **Review**               | NIST SP 800-53: AC-6 emphasizes restricting access to sensitive information based on the least privilege principle, ensuring users only have the permissions necessary to perform their specific roles. It helps prevent unauthorized access and protects information privacy. |
| **Recommendation(s)**    | 1. Implement automated access revocation or time-limited sharing permissions for sensitive folders. <br/> 2. Improve employee training and enforce stricter content-sharing policies to ensure that sensitive data is only shared appropriately. |
| **Justification**        | Automated access revocation reduces human error by ensuring access rights are automatically limited after a set period. Enhanced training and clearer sharing policies will reinforce the principle of least privilege, ensuring employees understand and follow secure data handling practices. |
