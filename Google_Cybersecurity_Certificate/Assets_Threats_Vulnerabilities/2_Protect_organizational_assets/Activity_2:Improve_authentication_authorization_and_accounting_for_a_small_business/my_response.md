# **Access Control Investigation - Worksheet**

| **Section** | **Details** |
| --- | --- |
| **Note(s)**           | - The suspicious activity occurred from the IP address 249.57.94.27 (Joanne Phelps), which was last accessed 2 years ago, while her access status is marked as seasonal and expired on 1/31/20.<br />- **Threat Actor**: Joanne Phelps - a former seasonal employee, who had expired access rights but still retained active permissions - was still active at the time of the incident, despite her temporary seasonal status and expired end date, indicating a possible lapse in access control and deactivation procedures.             |
| **Issue(s)**          | -**Authorization issue**: Joanne Phelps, a seasonal employee, still had admin-level access to the system even after her end date on 1/31/20. This is a serious security oversight.<br />- **Inactive account**: Her account should have been deactivated once her employment ended, but the account remained active and authorized, creating a potential access vulnerability.                                                                                                                                |
| **Recommendation(s)** | -**Recommendation 1**: Implement an automated process to revoke access to sensitive systems and resources when an employee's contract ends or when their employment status changes. This can help prevent unauthorized access from former employees or seasonal workers.<br />- **Recommendation 2**: Introduce periodic access reviews to ensure that all accounts, particularly those of temporary or seasonal employees, are properly deactivated or adjusted according to their current employment status |
