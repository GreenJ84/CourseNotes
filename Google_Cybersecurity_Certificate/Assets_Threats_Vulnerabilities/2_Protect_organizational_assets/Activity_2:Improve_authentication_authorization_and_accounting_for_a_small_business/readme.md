# **Access Control Investigation**

In this activity, you will assess the access controls used by a business. Youâ€™ll analyze their current process, identify issues, and make recommendations to improve their security practices. You will also review the access logs and employee directory to identify vulnerabilities and suggest security improvements to reduce future risks.

## **Scenario**

You are the first cybersecurity professional hired by a growing business. Recently, a deposit was made from the business to an unknown bank account, but the finance manager insists it was not a mistake. Fortunately, the payment was stopped. The business owner has asked you to investigate the incident and prevent similar occurrences in the future. Your task is to review the access log, identify possible security weaknesses, and recommend mitigations.

## **Instructions**

### Step 1: Access the template

- Use the **[Access control worksheet](./Access-control-worksheet.docx)** template for this course item.

### Step 2: Access supporting materials

- Use the **[Accounting exercise spreadsheet](./Accounting-exercise.xlsx)**, which contains two tabs for your reference.

### Step 3: Review the event log of this payroll incident

- Open the "Event log" tab in the Accounting exercise spreadsheet.
- Carefully examine the details of the incident, such as the Event Type, Date, Time, and IP Address.
- Make 1-2 notes about the user based on the event log and record them in the "Notes" column of the Access control worksheet.

### Step 4: Identify access control issues that led to the incident

- Open the "Employee directory" tab in the Accounting exercise spreadsheet.
- Compare the data in the Employee directory with the details in the Event log.
- Identify any access control issues related to how employee access is managed and note them in the "Issues" column of the Access control worksheet.

### Step 5: Recommend mitigations that can prevent a future breach

- In the "Recommendation(s)" column of the Access control worksheet, provide at least two recommendations for improving access controls to prevent incidents like this from happening again.
- Example recommendation: Implement procedures to revoke access when an employee leaves the company.

## **What to Include in your response**

- 1-2 notes about the user based on the event log.
- 1-2 access control issues you discovered during the review.
- 2 recommendations for access control mitigations to improve security and prevent future breaches.

## **Key Takeaways**

This activity highlights how easy it can be to lose track of users, which  can leave a business open to unnecessary risk if effective access controls are not in place. The activity also demonstrates the risk of operating a business with open, shared access to resources. Setting boundaries around who can access information and what they are allowed to do should be the starting point of any security plan.
