# **Home Office Network Asset Classification**

In this activity, you will classify assets connected to a home office network. Asset management is crucial for security, involving tracking, classifying, and protecting assets based on their sensitivity to risk.

## **Scenario**

You operate a small business from home and must create an inventory of network devices to identify which contain sensitive information requiring extra protection. Your home office includes devices such as a desktop computer, printer, router, webcam, speakers, headphones, and an external hard drive.

To complete this task:

1. Identify three devices connected to your home network.
2. List their characteristics, including network access, owner, and location.
3. Assign each device a sensitivity level based on its importance and potential security risks.

## **Instructions**

### **Step 1: Access the Template**

- Use the provided **[Home asset inventory](./Home-asset-inventory.xlsx)** spreadsheet as a Template to begin.

### **Step 2: Identify Assets**

- Locate the **Asset** column in the spreadsheet.
- Add at least three devices *not already listed in the template*, such as a laptop, smartphone, or smart home device.

### **Step 3: Fill in Device Characteristics**

For each identified device, record:

- **Network access** – How often the device connects to the network.
- **Owner** – Who is responsible for the device.
- **Location** – Its physical location in relation to the router.

### **Step 4: Evaluate Network Device Access**

- Review the listed characteristics.
- In the **Notes** column, add 1–2 key details about each device, considering:
  - Type of information stored.
  - Connection method.
  - Security measures in place.

### **Step 5: Classify Sensitivity of Devices**

- Assess the potential impact if the device were compromised.
- In the **Sensitivity** column, classify each device based on its risk level (e.g., Confidential, Public, etc.).


## **What to Include in Your Response**

- List of 3 home network devices.
- Network access, owner, and location for each.
- 1–2 notes on network access.
- Sensitivity classification for each device.

## **Key Takeaways**

Having an inventory of devices on your home network is a useful way to protect your personal assets. It’s also a useful artifact that you can show to prospective employers when interviewing for security analyst positions. Resources like this demonstrate your security mindset and ability to think critically about asset vulnerabilities.
