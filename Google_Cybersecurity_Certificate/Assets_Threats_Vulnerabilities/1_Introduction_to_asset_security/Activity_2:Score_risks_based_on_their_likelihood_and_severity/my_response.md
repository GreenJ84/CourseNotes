## **Notes**

Security events are possible given the risks the bank faces in its operating environment. For example, business email compromise can happen as employees may not be vigilant about phishing attempts. A compromised user database is more likely because customer data isn't well protected, and a financial records leak could occur if backup servers are misconfigured. Theft risks arise from human error, like leaving safes unlocked, while supply chain disruptions can stem from the bank's coastal location and susceptibility to natural disasters, which may cause delays in receiving necessary supplies.
