# **Risk Assessment Activity**

In this activity, you will assess vulnerabilities that could threaten business operations and prioritize resources based on assigned risk scores. The activity involves evaluating potential risks, scoring them for likelihood and severity, and calculating overall scores to help prioritize the most critical risks.

## **Scenario**

You are part of a cybersecurity team at a commercial bank, conducting a risk assessment to secure vulnerable assets. The team is creating a risk register to assess various threats. Your task is to evaluate risks, determine their likelihood and severity, and calculate risk scores to prioritize security efforts.

## **Instructions**

### Step 1: Access the template

- Use the provided to **[risk register template](./)**

### Step 2: Understand the operating environment

In this scenario, your team has identified characteristics of the operating environment that could factor into the bank's risk profile:

- The bank is located in a coastal area with low crime rates.
- 100 on-premise employees, 20 remote employees, and 2,200 accounts (individual and commercial).
- The bank's data is handled by multiple people and systems.
- Regulations require the bank to secure funds and data.

### Step 3: Consider potential risks

- Business email compromise
- Compromised user database
- Financial records leak
- Theft
- Supply chain attack

Consider these risks in the context of the bank's operating environment and summarize in 2-3 sentences how security events might occur.

### Step 4: Score risks based on likelihood

Estimate the likelihood of each risk occurring on a scale of 1-3:

- 1 = Low chance
- 2 = Moderate chance
- 3 = High chance

Enter your likelihood score for each risk.

### Step 5: Score risks based on severity

Estimate the severity of each risk on a scale of 1-3:

- 1 = Low severity
- 2 = Moderate severity
- 3 = High severity

Consider the impact on operations, finances, reputation, and regulatory compliance.

### Step 6: Calculate overall score

Use the formula: Likelihood x Severity = Risk Score. Enter the overall risk score for each risk, and prioritize the risks based on their score (1-9).

## **What to Include in your response**

- 2-3 sentences describing the risk factors.
- 5 likelihood scores.
- 5 severity scores.
- 5 overall risk scores.

## **Key takeaways**

Risk assessments are useful for identifying risks to an organizationâ€™s information, networks and systems. Security plans can benefit from regular risk assessments as a way of highlighting important concerns that should be addressed. Additionally, these assessments help keep track of any changes that can occur in an organization's operating environment.
