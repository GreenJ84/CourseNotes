# **Create a Cybersecurity Resume**

In this activity, you will create a resume (1-2 pages) that is tailored to a role in cybersecurity. A resume is a document that you create and use to present your background, skills, and accomplishments to potential employers when applying for jobs.

Be sure to complete this activity and answer the questions that follow before moving on. The next course item will provide you with a completed exemplar to compare to your own work.

## **Scenario**

Your resume gives potential employers a first impression of you and your qualifications. To prepare for your search for roles in cybersecurity, you will need to create a new resume or update your current one to reflect the skills and experiences you have gained from this program. First, you will search for and identify a target role. Then, as you craft your resume, you will tailor the content to match the requirements for that role.

**Note:** Crafting a strong resume is challenging and can take some time. For now, you should at least complete steps 1-6 of the activity, but feel free to finish the remainder of the steps later if you need more time. You will need to finish steps 1-9 to answer all of the questions at the end of this activity.

## **Instructions**

### Step 1: Select a resume template

- Open the [template gallery](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/?ftv=1) in Google Docs or another word processing application.
- Go to the resumes section and examine the templates.
- Choose one template for your resume, and open it.
- Rename the document “Resume [Your Name].”
- Alternatively, if you already have a resume, open that document instead.

### Step 2: Research cybersecurity roles

- Think about the cybersecurity roles that interest you based on your skills and experience.

### Step 3: Take notes on your research

- Add a blank page to your resume document or open a new document for notes.

### Step 5: Add your skills
