# **Cybersecurity Role Elevator Pitch**

In this activity, you will research cybersecurity roles on a job search website and record notes on a position that interests you. Then, you will practice preparing to interview for that role by writing an elevator pitch.

An elevator pitch is a short, memorable description that explains a concept in an easy-to-understand way. Elevator pitches are helpful for introducing yourself to career and business connections. They can be used in formal and informal ways. For example, meeting another security practitioner at an industry event or during a job interview.

Be sure to complete this activity before moving on. The next course item will provide you with a completed exemplar to compare to your own work.

## **Scenario**

To create a strong elevator pitch, you need to consider how to present yourself as a suitable candidate for a specific role. Before you begin writing your pitch, you will determine what industry benefits you are looking for in a cybersecurity role. Then, you will research relevant roles on a job search website and identify one that appeals to you. Next, you will review the job description for the position and record key information about your relevant experience, skills, and details about the company. After, you will write a 30- to 60-second elevator pitch using that information. Your elevator pitch will focus on describing yourself, your professional experience and skills, and why you are an ideal candidate for the role.

**Note:** While this is a practice exercise and you won’t actually be applying for the role you’ve identified (unless you choose to), you can implement this process to search for relevant roles and draft corresponding elevator pitches in the future.
