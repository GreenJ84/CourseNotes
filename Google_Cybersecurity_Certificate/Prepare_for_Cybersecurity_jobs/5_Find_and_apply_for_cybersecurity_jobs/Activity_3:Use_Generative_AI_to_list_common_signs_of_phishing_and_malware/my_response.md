# **Gen AI Phishing Analysis**

## **Question 1**

Which parts of the prompting framework did you find most useful? *(Select all that apply.)*

- **Task (including persona and format)** – Specifying the audience (non-technical employees) and format (bullet points) helped tailor the output.
- **Context** – Adding details like "align with IT security policy" improved relevance.

## **Question 2**

**Submitted Prompt:**

```txt
Act as a senior cybersecurity management professional and create a one-page reference guide for non-technical employees, using bullet points and simple language, that lists:

1. **5 common signs of phishing emails** (e.g., urgent requests, mismatched sender addresses).
2. **3 symptoms of malware infection** (e.g., slow performance, unexpected pop-ups).
3. **Actions to take** (e.g., report to IT, don’t click links).
Include examples from Google’s 2023 phishing report and align with our ‘Cybersecurity Best Practices’ handbook. Use bold headers for readability.
```

## **Question 3**

**How iterating improved the output:**
Evaluating the initial draft revealed vague generalizations, while iterating added specificity (e.g., actionable steps, real-world examples, AI persona). The final guide was clearer, more actionable, and tailored to the audience.

**Key Takeaway:**
The TCREI framework transformed a generic prompt into a targeted, high-quality output through structured refinement.
