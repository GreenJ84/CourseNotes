# **Identifying Phishing and Malware with Gen AI**

In this activity, you’ll use a gen AI tool and the **TCREI prompting framework** to identify and list common signs of phishing and malware in emails. Completing this activity will help refine your prompting skills, though it’s not required to progress in the course or earn your Google certificate.

## **Scenario**

Imagine you’re a cybersecurity professional at a company where employees have reported an increase in phishing emails. Your manager asks you to create a **reference guide** to train the team on identifying phishing and malware threats. You decide to use gen AI to draft the guide, applying the TCREI framework step by step.

## **Instructions**

### **Step 1: Enter Your Initial Prompt**

Start with a basic prompt to generate a draft reference guide. Example:

- **Prompt:** *"Write a reference guide on phishing emails and malware."*
- Treat this as a starting point for refinement.

### **Step 2: Evaluate the Initial Output**

Assess the AI’s response:

- Is the guide **accurate, unbiased, and complete**?
- Is the **tone appropriate** for your audience?
- Would employees across departments **understand it easily**?
- Note areas for improvement.

### **Step 3: Revise and Refine Your Prompt**

Enhance your prompt using the TCREI framework:

- **Context:** Specify audience (e.g., non-technical staff), tone, or accessibility needs.
- **References:** Include company policies or examples of phishing tactics.
- **Format:** Request bullet points, visuals, or word limits.
- Example refinement: *"Create a concise, non-technical guide with bullet points on phishing email red flags and malware symptoms, aligned with our IT security policy."*

### **Step 4: Evaluate the Output Again**

Review the revised output:

- Does it now meet your goals?
- Are there gaps to address in another iteration?

### **Step 5: Take an Iterative Approach**

Repeat **Steps 3–4** until satisfied. Ensure the guide is:

- **Comprehensive** (covers key threats).
- **Clear** (understandable for all employees).

### **Step 6: Questions and Submission**

1. **Question 1:** Which parts of the TCREI framework were most useful? *(Select all that apply.)*
   - Task (including persona and format)
   - Context
   - References
   - Evaluate
   - Iterate
2. **Question 2:** Submit your **final prompt** (with sufficient context/references).
3. **Question 3:** How did evaluating and iterating improve the output? *(1–2 sentences.)*
