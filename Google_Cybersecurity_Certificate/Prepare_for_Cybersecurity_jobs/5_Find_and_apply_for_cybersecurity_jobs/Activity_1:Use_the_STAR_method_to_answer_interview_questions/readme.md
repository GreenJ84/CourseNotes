In this activity, you will answer two common behavioral interview questions using the STAR method. The STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) helps structure your responses clearly and effectively, showcasing your skills and experiences in a compelling way. Completing this activity prepares you for real interview scenarios by organizing your thoughts and practicing your delivery.

## **Scenario**

Behavioral interview questions allow interviewers to assess your past experiences and how you handle challenges. Using the STAR method ensures your responses are structured, logical, and impactful. This activity guides you through preparing and practicing responses to two common behavioral questions, helping you build confidence for actual interviews.
