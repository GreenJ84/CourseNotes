## **Understand Your Stakeholders**

### Who Are Stakeholders?

A **stakeholder** is any **individual or group** that has an interest in the decisions or activities of an organization. In cybersecurity, they‚Äôre the people who care about **security incidents, risks, and responses**.

### Organizational Hierarchy (From Analyst ‚Üí Executive)

You may not report directly to all stakeholders, but your work **impacts them**. Understanding who they are is key to effective communication.

### Key Stakeholders and Their Roles

| **Stakeholder**        | **Role in Security**                                                       |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Risk Manager**       | Identifies and mitigates risks; communicates with legal and PR                   |
| **CEO**                | Oversees all business decisions, including security                              |
| **CFO**                | Focuses on financial impact of security incidents                                |
| **CISO**               | Designs security architecture and strategy; top security decision-maker          |
| **Operations Manager** | Leads day-to-day security operations; most likely to work directly with analysts |

üîé **Note**: As an entry-level analyst, you'll **primarily report to operations managers**, who relay information up to C-level stakeholders like the CFO and CISO.

## **Stakeholder Communication for Analysts**

### What and How to Communicate

- Report **security issues** and **potential causes** clearly
- Include relevant facts: **what happened**, **when**, and **potential impact**
- Use **concise language** appropriate for non-technical audiences when needed
- Communicate **confidentially** and only with the **relevant audience**

#### Up the command chain

- **Entry-level analysts ‚Üí Operations/Risk Managers**
- **Ops/Risk Managers ‚Üí CFOs/CISOs**
- **CFOs/CISOs ‚Üí CEOs**
- Even if you're not talking to the execs directly, your reports **influence** the decisions they make.

#### Example

You detect multiple failed login attempts by an employee:

- Report to operations manager
- They verify the cause and escalate if needed
- You may assist with implementing preventative measures (e.g., stronger login policies)

### Your Role in Stakeholder Communication

As a security analyst, the information you share is **sensitive** and potentially high-impact. Communicating **clearly**, **concisely**, and with **purpose** is critical. Different stakeholders have different concerns, so tailoring your message is essential.

> Remember: Security is a detail-driven field ‚Äî **accuracy** matters just as much as **clarity**.

#### Best Practices for Effective Communication

- Be Clear and Purposeful
- Avoid unnecessary **technical jargon**
- Ensure the **purpose of your message** is immediately obvious
- Confirm you‚Äôre communicating with the **right person** about the **right issue**

Ask yourself:

- What do I want this person to know?
- Why is it important for them to know it?
- When do they need to take action?
- How do I explain this in a non-technical way?

#### Security Mindset in Communication

Having a security mindset means:

- Asking what data/assets are most critical
- Understanding what **matters to stakeholders**
- Sharing only the **most relevant** details

> The goal is to **inform**, not overwhelm.

#### Tell a ‚ÄúSecurity Story‚Äù

Think of stakeholder communication like storytelling:

| **Story Element** | **Security Communication Equivalent** |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Beginning               | What's the issue?                           |
| Middle                  | What‚Äôs the impact and context?             |
| End                     | What are possible solutions?                |

##### Example Scenario

- **Issue:** Malicious code detected in logs
- **Reference:** Use incident response playbook to validate the finding
- **Solution:** Propose a potential fix, even if you're not the decision-maker

## **Communicating With Visuals**

Use visuals when:

- Data is complex or voluminous
- A pictorial summary helps clarify impact or urgency

Examples:

- Charts
- Graphs
- Dashboards (e.g., via Google Sheets)

> You‚Äôll get hands-on practice creating dashboards later in the course.

### Matching Content and Method

Your **method of communication** depends on what you're sharing:

| **Scenario**               | **Best Communication Method** |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Quick status update              | Instant message or phone call       |
| Complex issue                    | Email or in-person/video meeting    |
| Data-heavy situation             | Graph, spreadsheet, or dashboard    |
| Escalation of an anomaly in logs | Email or ticket system with detail  |

Before you send a message, verify:

- You're using an **approved platform**
- The information is **relevant and necessary**
- The recipient has the **authority and interest** to act
