# **Course 8: Prepare for Cybersecurity Jobs**

Welcome to the final course in the Google Cybersecurity Certificate program! In this course, you’ll bring together all the key security concepts and skills you've developed so far and learn how to apply them in real-world professional settings.

Your instructor Dion, a Program Manager at Google with experience in areas like risk management and insider threat detection, will guide you through the first part of this course. Later, Emily will take over to introduce valuable resources for engaging with the cybersecurity community.

As a security analyst, your responsibility is to help protect an organization’s most valuable assets—both tangible (like software and network devices) and intangible (such as personal identifiable information, copyrights, and intellectual property). The exposure of these assets can result in serious consequences for the organization and its stakeholders, which is why proper incident detection, escalation, and communication are so critical.

In previous courses, you've explored a wide range of foundational topics—from core security concepts and frameworks to networks, vulnerabilities, incident response, and even programming basics. Now, you'll build on that foundation with more practical, career-focused skills. You’ll gain confidence in your ability to protect assets, influence decisions, and prepare for a job in the security field.
