# **Protect Data and Communicate Incidents**

This module introduces the structure of Course 8 and reinforces the critical role that security professionals play in maintaining an organization's security posture. It emphasizes the value of incident detection and escalation and explores how a strong ethical mindset helps analysts protect sensitive assets and data.

## **Learning Objectives**

* Recognize the importance of incident detection
* Describe the importance of various asset types
* Examine the relationship between events and incidents
* Determine incidents that need escalation to stakeholders
* Recognize the sensitivity of secured assets and data
* Explain how an ethical security mindset supports effective protection

## **Protect data and Communicate incidents**

### Security Mindset

* A **security mindset** involves constantly evaluating risk and identifying potential or actual breaches.
* It includes:
  * Recognizing what you're defending (assets)
  * Understanding what or who you’re defending against (threats)
* Security is an  **everyday objective** —you must assume that  **every click has risk** .

> *“That level of scrutiny helps prepare for the worst-case scenario—even if it doesn’t happen.”*

* Staying up to date with security threats sharpens your mindset and supports stronger protective strategies.

### Data Classification Types

| Classification         | Description                                                | Examples                                          |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Public**       | Open to the public, minimal risk if exposed                | Press releases, marketing materials               |
| **Private**      | Not public, higher security level required                 | Employee ID numbers, research data                |
| **Sensitive**    | Access limited to authorized personnel                     | PII, SPII, PHI, banking info, SSNs                |
| **Confidential** | Essential for business operations, often protected by NDAs | Trade secrets, financial records, government data |

* Data classification helps determine the **level of protection** required for each data type.

### Asset Classification

* **Low-level assets** : Minimal damage if compromised
* Example: Company website address, public job postings
* **High-level assets** : Significant damage if compromised
* Example: Internal emails with trade secrets, SPII, PHI

> *Asset classification helps prioritize security measures according to potential impact.*

### Consequences of Security Incidents

* **Financial loss**
* **Regulatory fines**
* **Loss of credibility or trust**
* **Operational downtime**
* **Breach of customer data** (e.g., SSNs, credit cards, emails, login credentials)

## **Your Impact on Data Protection**

This section emphasizes the crucial role entry-level security professionals play in protecting organizational data. It explores how even small actions can prevent breaches, and highlights the importance of communication, collaboration, and cautious incident reporting. It also introduces the concepts of **business continuity** and **disaster recovery planning** as essential elements of organizational resilience.

### Collaboration & Your Role

* **Security is a team effort**: Multiple departments care about different aspects of protection—financial data, credentials, vendor systems, and employee PII.
* **Your decisions matter**: Every action you take has the potential to protect or endanger sensitive assets.
* **Always escalate questionable events**: Even small issues (e.g., unauthorized app installations) can evolve into larger threats.

> *“There are no issues that are too small or too big. If you're unsure, report it.”*


### Event vs. Incident

* **Event**: Any observable occurrence in a system or network.
* **Incident**: An event that results in a **confirmed breach** or causes harm.
  * Example: A suspicious log with no breach = event  
  * If malicious code is executed and causes damage = incident

> The key is identifying when an event escalates into an incident—and acting quickly.

## **Disaster Recovery & Business Continuity**

### 4-Part Security Process

1. **Identify** critical assets
2. **Assess threats** to those assets
3. **Detect** threats using tools/processes
4. **Plan** for continuity and recovery

### Business Continuity Plan (BCP)

A structured approach to keep business functions operational during and after disruption.

**4 Key Steps**:

1. **Business Impact Analysis (BIA)** – Understand potential consequences of disrupted operations  
2. **Recovery Procedures** – Steps to restore key business functions  
3. **Form a Continuity Team** – Members from IT, HR, Comms, Cybersecurity, etc.  
4. **Training & Simulation** – Run practice drills based on real-world scenarios

### Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP)

Focuses on **minimizing and recovering** from incidents like ransomware or system failures.

**Key Components**:

* Software recovery strategies
* Hardware restoration processes
* Identification of impacted apps and data

## **Key Takeaways**

* Every organization uses its own  **data classification policy** —understanding and adhering to this is crucial.
* **Security professionals protect both low- and high-level assets** —both require appropriate levels of defense.
* Developing and maintaining a **security-first mindset** is a defining trait of an effective entry-level analyst.
* **Incident detection** and **decision-making in escalation** are fundamental to minimizing harm to organizational data and assets.

* Your role in protecting assets **directly impacts your company’s success and customers’ trust**.

* Even small missteps can have major consequences—**attention to detail is critical**.
* Know the difference between events and incidents, and **report when in doubt**.
* Business continuity and disaster recovery plans are **essential safeguards** that ensure organizations can bounce back from disruptions.
