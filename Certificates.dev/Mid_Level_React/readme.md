# **React**

React is a declarative, component-driven library for building interactive user interfaces. These notes help deepen the understanding of React’s internal model, architectural patterns, ecosystem tooling, and production-grade application design. Content spans the complete modern React workflow: JavaScript foundations, JSX, component design, hooks, state modeling, routing, and TypeScript integration. It has been refined for long-term mastery and professional readiness.

## **Learning Objectives**

* Strengthen mid-level React knowledge into expert-level conceptual and practical understanding.
* Master core React abstractions including components, hooks, state, rendering, and data flow.
* Apply professional development tooling, debugging practices, and architectural patterns.
* Use TypeScript to improve reliability, scalability, and team collaboration within React projects.

## **Competencies**

* Apply modern JavaScript features to build maintainable React codebases.
* Architect scalable UI systems using reusable components and predictable data flows.
* Model and manage state efficiently across local, derived, and global layers.
* Apply React Hooks with expert understanding of lifecycle, closures, and rendering behavior.
* Configure modern React tooling (bundlers, linters, formatters, devtools) for professional development environments.
* Implement routing strategies for complex UI navigation patterns.
* Integrate TypeScript for type safety, robust API contracts, and maintainable component APIs.
* Debug, profile, and optimize React applications with industry-standard tools.

## **What Do You Need?**

To follow you will need to have the following setup on your computer.

1. Node.js

   * Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a web browser.
   * To code along with the React challenges you need Node.js version 16.0 or above.
   * You can download and install Node.js by following the instructions provided on their official website:
     * [Node](https://nodejs.org/)
2. npm

   * npm is a package manager for Node.js and is used to install dependencies and manage packages. It is included with the Node.js download.
3. Editor

   * The recommended code editor for the React Developer Certification Program is Visual Studio Code (VS Code). VS Code is a lightweight and versatile code editor that provides a wide range of features and extensions for React development.
   * You can download and install VS Code by following the instructions provided on their official website:
     * [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
   * If you like, you can also review the React Editor Setup guide for additional tips on configuring your editor for React development, including ESLint, Prettier, and more.
4. React Developer Tools

   * React Developer Tools is a browser extension that allows you to inspect and debug React applications. It provides a set of tools for analyzing the component hierarchy, state, and props of your React applications.
   * You can install the React Developer Tools extension for your browser by following the instructions provided on their official website:
      * [React Developer Tools](https://react.dev/learn/react-developer-tools)

## **Additional Resources**

[Thinking in React](https://react.dev/learn/thinking-in-react) — A canonical guide to the React approach for building UIs. Topics covered:

* Break down a UI into a component hierarchy
* Build a static version with no interactivity
* Identify the minimal representation of UI state
* Determine where state should live
* Add inverse data flow

This guide is essential for internalizing the React philosophy and designing predictable, maintainable component trees.
